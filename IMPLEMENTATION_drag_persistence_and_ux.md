# Implementation Plan: Drag Persistence, Auto-Center, and Button Styling

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of four critical UX improvements to CollabCanvas:
1. Preserve drag position on connection loss or page reload
2. Eliminate position flash after drag ends
3. Auto-center view on page load, login, and reconnection
4. Modernize recenter button styling to match toolbar aesthetic

---

## Feature 1: Drag Position Persistence During Connection Loss

### Problem Description

**Current Behavior:**
When a user drags a shape and loses connection or the page reloads during the drag:
- The shape reverts to its original position (where it was when drag started)
- All intermediate drag progress is lost
- Other users never see the last dragged position

**Why This Happens:**
- Drag positions are broadcast at 100Hz via in-memory RTDB drag streams
- These streams are ephemeral and cleared on disconnect
- Final position is only saved to RTDB when drag ends (on mouse release)
- If page reloads or connection drops before mouse release, the final save never happens
- On reconnect/reload, the app loads the last persisted position from RTDB (the original position)

**Expected Behavior:**
- During drag, periodically save checkpoints to RTDB
- If connection is lost or page reloads, the last checkpoint position should be preserved
- Other users should see the shape at the last checkpoint position, not the original position

### Solution Design

**Approach: Periodic Checkpoint System**

Add a checkpoint mechanism that runs parallel to the existing 100Hz drag stream:
- Keep the existing 100Hz drag stream for real-time position updates (don't break this!)
- Add a separate checkpoint interval that writes to RTDB every 500ms during drag
- Checkpoints write the actual position data to the shapes collection in RTDB
- If connection is lost, the last checkpoint (max 500ms old) is preserved in RTDB
- On reconnect/reload, users see the checkpoint position, not the original position

**Why 500ms?**
- Frequent enough to capture drag progress (2 checkpoints per second)
- Infrequent enough to avoid excessive RTDB writes (efficiency)
- Maximum staleness of 500ms is acceptable (users won't notice)
- Balances responsiveness with performance

### Implementation Steps

#### File: `src/components/Canvas/ShapeRenderer.jsx`

**Modify `handleDragStart` function:**

Current flow:
1. Acquire lock
2. Set `isDraggingRef.current = true`
3. Call `onDragStart`
4. Start 100Hz drag stream interval

New flow (add checkpoint):
1. Acquire lock
2. Set `isDraggingRef.current = true`
3. Call `onDragStart`
4. Start 100Hz drag stream interval (unchanged)
5. **NEW:** Start 500ms checkpoint interval that writes to RTDB

The checkpoint interval should:
- Run every 500ms while dragging
- Get current Konva node position: `node.x()`, `node.y()`, `node.rotation()`
- Call `updateShape()` from `canvasRTDB.js` to persist position to RTDB
- Pass the shape ID, position data, and user object
- This creates a persistent checkpoint that survives disconnects

**Modify `handleDragEnd` function:**

Current flow:
1. Stop 100Hz drag stream
2. Get final position from Konva node
3. Call parent `onDragEnd` with final position
4. Clear `isDraggingRef` flag

New flow (stop checkpoint):
1. Stop 100Hz drag stream (unchanged)
2. **NEW:** Stop 500ms checkpoint interval
3. Get final position from Konva node
4. Call parent `onDragEnd` with final position (this writes final position)
5. Clear `isDraggingRef` flag

**Modify `handleTransformStart` function:**

Same approach as drag start:
- Keep existing 100Hz transform stream (unchanged)
- Add 500ms checkpoint interval for position/size/rotation
- Write to RTDB using `updateShape()`

**Modify `handleTransformEnd` function:**

Same approach as drag end:
- Stop 100Hz transform stream (unchanged)
- Stop 500ms checkpoint interval
- Call parent with final attributes (unchanged)

**Add cleanup in unmount useEffect:**

Make sure checkpoint intervals are cleared when component unmounts:
- Check if checkpoint interval exists
- Clear it
- Set to null

**Store checkpoint interval in ref:**

Add a new ref at the top of the component:
```
const checkpointInterval = useRef(null);
```

This keeps track of the checkpoint interval separately from the drag stream interval.

### Why This Solution is KISS/DRY

**KISS (Keep It Simple):**
- Reuses existing `updateShape()` function (no new functions needed)
- Simple setInterval/clearInterval pattern (already used for drag stream)
- Runs in parallel with existing drag stream (no interference)
- No complex state management

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
- Uses same RTDB service functions already in place
- Follows same pattern as drag stream interval
- No duplicate position-writing logic

**SRP (Single Responsibility):**
- Checkpoint interval: Responsible for periodic persistence
- Drag stream: Responsible for real-time broadcasting (unchanged)
- Final save: Responsible for authoritative position (unchanged)

### Testing

**Test Case 1: Connection Loss During Drag**
1. User A drags shape from (1000, 1000) to (5000, 5000)
2. At position (3000, 3000), disconnect internet
3. Page reloads or connection drops
4. Expected: Shape appears at ~(3000, 3000) (last checkpoint within 500ms)
5. Not at: (1000, 1000) (original position)

**Test Case 2: Page Reload During Drag**
1. User A drags shape across canvas
2. Mid-drag, press Cmd+R to reload page
3. Expected: Shape appears near last position when drag happened
4. User B should also see shape at checkpoint position

**Test Case 3: Normal Drag (No Interruption)**
1. User A drags shape and releases normally
2. Expected: Final position is pixel-perfect (from drag end save)
3. Checkpoints should not interfere with normal operation

## Feature 2: Eliminate Position Flash After Drag Ends

### Problem Description

**Current Behavior:**
When user releases mouse after dragging a shape:
- The shape briefly flashes back to its initial position
- Then snaps to the correct final position
- This creates a jarring visual glitch

**Why This Happens:**

The flash occurs due to a race condition in the position update flow:

1. User releases mouse â†’ `handleDragEnd` fires
2. `handleDragEnd` sets `isDraggingRef.current = false` **immediately**
3. `handleDragEnd` calls parent `onDragEnd` which writes final position to RTDB
4. RTDB broadcasts update to all clients (including the dragging user)
5. React re-renders with new props from RTDB
6. Position sync `useEffect` (lines 46-75 in ShapeRenderer.jsx) triggers
7. Because `isDraggingRef.current = false` now, the effect is NOT blocked
8. Effect sees position changed, calls `node.position(newPos)`
9. This causes a brief visual flash as Konva redraws

The timing issue:
- Konva already has the correct position (user just dragged it there)
- But the effect tries to "sync" it with incoming RTDB props
- This creates a unnecessary position update that causes the flash

**Expected Behavior:**
- Smooth transition from dragging to final position
- No visible flash or position jump
- Position should appear stable and fluid

### Solution Design

**Approach: Delayed isDraggingRef Reset**

Keep `isDraggingRef` true for a short duration after drag ends to block the position sync effect until RTDB update completes.

**Why This Works:**
- The position sync effect checks `isDraggingRef` before syncing
- By keeping it true for 100ms after drag end, we block premature syncing
- The RTDB update arrives within this window
- When `isDraggingRef` finally becomes false, Konva position already matches props
- No position delta, no flash

**Why 100ms?**
- RTDB updates typically arrive within 50-100ms
- Long enough to prevent the flash
- Short enough to not interfere with rapid successive drags
- Users won't notice the 100ms delay

### Implementation Steps

#### File: `src/components/Canvas/ShapeRenderer.jsx`

**Modify `handleDragEnd` function:**

Current flow:
1. Stop drag stream
2. Get final position
3. Call parent `onDragEnd`
4. Set `isDraggingRef.current = false` **immediately**

New flow (delay flag reset):
1. Stop drag stream (unchanged)
2. Get final position (unchanged)
3. Call parent `onDragEnd` (unchanged)
4. **NEW:** Set `isDraggingRef.current = false` inside a `setTimeout` with 100ms delay

Use this pattern:
```
setTimeout(() => {
  isDraggingRef.current = false;
}, 100);
```

This delays the flag reset, keeping the position sync effect blocked until RTDB update arrives.

**Modify `handleTransformEnd` function:**

Apply the same pattern:
1. Stop transform stream (unchanged)
2. Get final attributes (unchanged)
3. Call parent `onTransformEnd` (unchanged)
4. **NEW:** Delay `isDraggingRef.current = false` by 100ms using `setTimeout`

**Handle Rapid Successive Drags:**

If user starts a new drag before the 100ms timeout completes:
- The timeout will set `isDraggingRef` to false
- But the new drag's `handleDragStart` will immediately set it back to true
- No issue, this is safe

**Handle Component Unmount:**

If component unmounts before timeout completes:
- Clear the timeout in the cleanup useEffect
- Add timeout ref to track it: `const dragEndTimeoutRef = useRef(null);`
- Store timeout ID when created
- Clear timeout in cleanup function

### Why This Solution is KISS/DRY

**KISS (Keep It Simple):**
- Single setTimeout to delay flag reset
- No complex state management
- No new effects or watchers
- Minimal code change (add one setTimeout)

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
- Same pattern for both drag and transform
- Reuses existing `isDraggingRef` flag
- No new blocking mechanisms needed

**SRP (Single Responsibility):**
- `isDraggingRef`: Responsible for blocking position sync during active operations
- Extended slightly to cover RTDB propagation window

### Testing

**Test Case 1: Drag End Flash**
1. User drags shape from point A to point B
2. Release mouse
3. Expected: Smooth, stable position at point B
4. Not expected: Brief flash or jump back to point A

**Test Case 2: Rapid Successive Drags**
1. User drags shape quickly multiple times in succession
2. Expected: All drags work smoothly
3. No interference from previous drag's timeout

**Test Case 3: Drag Then Transform**
1. User drags shape
2. Immediately starts transforming (resizing/rotating)
3. Expected: Smooth transition, no flash

## Feature 3: Auto-Center View on Key Events

### Problem Description

**Current Behavior:**
- On page load: View position is whatever was last saved in localStorage
- On login: View stays where it is
- On offline â†’ online transition: View stays where it is
- Users often get "lost" on the large canvas (30000x30000px)

**Expected Behavior:**
- On page load: Automatically center view to canvas center
- On user login: Automatically center view to canvas center  
- On offline â†’ online transition: Automatically center view to canvas center
- Provides consistent, predictable view position

**Why This is Useful:**
- Large canvas can be disorienting
- Users need a "home position" to return to
- Automatic centering provides spatial orientation
- Reduces user confusion and navigation time

### Solution Design

**Approach: Event-Driven Auto-Center**

Add useEffect hooks that watch for specific events and trigger the center view function when they occur.

**Events to Watch:**
1. **Initial page load** - Component mount with no previous state
2. **User login** - Auth state changes from null to user object
3. **Reconnection** - Connection status changes from offline to connected

**Reuse Existing Function:**
The `getCenteredPosition()` function already exists in Canvas.jsx and calculates the centered viewport position. We just need to call it and apply the position at the right times.

### Implementation Steps

#### File: `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.jsx`

**Modify viewport initialization:**

Current code (lines 73-84):
- Initializes `stagePos` based on localStorage OR calculates centered position
- Comment says "ALWAYS start centered on page load - ignore saved position"
- But the logic still tries to load from localStorage

New approach:
- Remove localStorage loading for position
- Always initialize to centered position
- This handles the "page load" requirement

**Add useEffect for login event:**

Watch the `user` object from auth context:
- When `user` changes from `null` to a valid user object, it means login occurred
- Trigger auto-center by calling `getCenteredPosition()` and `setStagePos()`
- Only trigger on login, not on every user object change

Pattern:
```
useEffect(() => {
  // Check if this is a login event (user changed from null to valid)
  if (user && user.uid) {
    // Calculate centered position
    const centeredPos = getCenteredPosition(stageScale);
    // Apply centered position
    setStagePos(centeredPos);
  }
}, [user, getCenteredPosition, stageScale]);
```

Add conditional logic to only center on actual login, not on every render.

**Add useEffect for reconnection event:**

The ConnectionStatus component already tracks connection state, but Canvas.jsx needs its own connection monitoring.

Import Firebase RTDB connection monitoring:
```
import { ref as rtdbRef, onValue } from 'firebase/database';
```

Add useEffect that watches `.info/connected` path:
```
useEffect(() => {
  const db = rtdb; // Already imported
  const connectedRef = rtdbRef(db, '.info/connected');
  
  let wasOffline = false;
  
  const unsubscribe = onValue(connectedRef, (snapshot) => {
    const isConnected = snapshot.val();
    
    if (isConnected && wasOffline) {
      // Just reconnected (was offline, now online)
      // Auto-center the view
      const centeredPos = getCenteredPosition(stageScale);
      setStagePos(centeredPos);
      showFeedback('Reconnected - View centered');
    }
    
    wasOffline = !isConnected;
  });
  
  return () => unsubscribe();
}, [getCenteredPosition, stageScale, showFeedback]);
```

This tracks offline/online transitions and centers view when reconnection happens.

**Remove localStorage persistence for position:**

Current code saves viewport to localStorage on every change (lines 115-120).

New approach:
- Keep localStorage saving for scale (zoom level is useful to persist)
- Remove localStorage saving for position (always center instead)
- Update the localStorage key to only store scale

This ensures consistent behavior: always centered position, but preserved zoom level.

### Why This Solution is KISS/DRY

**KISS (Keep It Simple):**
- Leverages existing `getCenteredPosition()` function
- Simple useEffect patterns for event watching
- No complex state machines
- Clear trigger conditions

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
- Reuses `getCenteredPosition()` in all three cases
- Reuses `setStagePos()` to apply position
- No duplicate centering logic

**SRP (Single Responsibility):**
- Each useEffect has one job: Watch event â†’ Center view
- `getCenteredPosition()`: Calculates centered position
- `setStagePos()`: Applies position

### Testing

**Test Case 1: Page Load Auto-Center**
1. Open CollabCanvas in browser
2. Expected: View is centered on canvas
3. Canvas center point (15000, 15000) should be at viewport center

**Test Case 2: Login Auto-Center**
1. Open app while logged out
2. Pan view to random location
3. Sign in with user account
4. Expected: View automatically centers
5. Shows "View centered" feedback

**Test Case 3: Reconnection Auto-Center**
1. While using app, disconnect internet
2. Pan view to random location (won't persist since offline)
3. Reconnect internet
4. Expected: View automatically centers
5. Shows "Reconnected - View centered" feedback

**Test Case 4: Zoom Level Preserved**
1. Zoom in to 2x
2. Refresh page
3. Expected: Zoom level is still 2x (from localStorage)
4. Position is centered (not from localStorage)

## Feature 4: Modernize Recenter Button Styling

### Problem Description

**Current Appearance:**
- Large button with emoji ðŸŽ¯ and "Center View" text
- Blue background (#007AFF)
- Bottom-right corner placement
- Doesn't match the clean, minimalistic aesthetic of the toolbar buttons

**Expected Appearance:**
- Match the ShapeToolbar button style
- Clean white/gray gradient background
- Minimalistic crosshair/target icon instead of emoji
- Smaller, more refined size
- Consistent with app's design system

### Solution Design

**Approach: Match ShapeToolbar Button Style**

The ShapeToolbar buttons (in ShapeToolbar.jsx) have a refined design:
- 48px Ã— 48px square
- White/gray gradient background
- 1px border with subtle shadow
- 10px border radius
- Hover effects: Gray background, slight lift
- Active effects: Darker gray, scale down
- Clean, professional aesthetic

Apply the same style to the recenter button.

**Icon Design:**

Replace emoji ðŸŽ¯ with a minimalistic crosshair/target icon:
- Use Unicode characters or SVG path
- Options:
  - `âŠ•` (circled plus)
  - `âŠ—` (circled times)
  - `â—Ž` (bullseye)
  - `âŒ–` (crosshair)
  - Custom SVG crosshair shape

Best option: Simple SVG crosshair with four lines pointing to center, matching the canvas center indicator already in the app.

### Implementation Steps

#### File: `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.jsx`

**Replace recenter button implementation:**

Current location: Lines 2222-2261

New implementation should:

**Remove current button:**
- Delete the entire button element from lines 2223-2261
- Remove emoji and "Center View" text

**Add new button matching ShapeToolbar style:**

Create button with these properties:
- **Size:** 48px Ã— 48px (same as toolbar buttons)
- **Position:** Fixed at bottom-right (20px from bottom, 20px from right)
- **Background:** White/gray gradient matching toolbar:
  - Default: `linear-gradient(135deg, #ffffff 0%, #fafbfc 100%)`
  - Hover: `linear-gradient(135deg, #f9fafb 0%, #f3f4f6 100%)`
  - Active: `linear-gradient(135deg, #e5e7eb 0%, #d1d5db 100%)`
- **Border:** `1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)`
- **Border radius:** `10px`
- **Shadow:** `0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)`
- **Transition:** `all 0.2s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`

**Add crosshair icon:**

Use inline SVG for the crosshair icon:
```
<svg> element with viewBox="0 0 24 24"
Four lines forming a crosshair:
- Vertical line from top to center
- Vertical line from center to bottom
- Horizontal line from left to center
- Horizontal line from center to right
- Small circle at center
```

Style the SVG with:
- Stroke: `#374151` (gray-700)
- Stroke width: 2
- No fill
- Size: 20px Ã— 20px (fits in 48px button)

**Add hover effects:**

On mouse enter:
- Change background to hover gradient
- Transform: `translateY(-1px)` (slight lift)
- Shadow: `0 3px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)` (stronger shadow)

On mouse leave:
- Revert to default background
- Transform: `translateY(0)`
- Shadow: `0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)`

On mouse down (active):
- Background: Active gradient
- Transform: `scale(0.96)` (slight press effect)
- Shadow: `0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) inset` (inset shadow)

**Add tooltip:**

Add `title` attribute with descriptive text:
```
title="Center View (0 or Home)"
```

This matches the keyboard shortcut already implemented.

**Optional: Add to ShapeToolbar instead:**

Alternative approach (if preferred):
- Add recenter button as new item in ShapeToolbar
- Place it at bottom of toolbar, after z-index controls
- Fully integrated with toolbar layout
- Benefit: All controls in one place
- Requires modifying ShapeToolbar.jsx instead of Canvas.jsx

### Why This Solution is KISS/DRY

**KISS (Keep It Simple):**
- Direct style application
- No new components needed
- Simple SVG icon
- Standard hover/active patterns

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
- Reuses exact gradient values from ShapeToolbar
- Reuses transition timing functions
- Consistent with existing design system

**SRP (Single Responsibility):**
- Button: Display and handle click
- SVG Icon: Visual representation
- Styles: Match design system

### Testing

**Test Case 1: Visual Consistency**
1. Open app and view ShapeToolbar (right side)
2. Look at recenter button (bottom-right)
3. Expected: Same visual style (colors, shadows, borders)
4. Cohesive design language

**Test Case 2: Hover Behavior**
1. Hover over recenter button
2. Expected: Subtle gray background, slight lift
3. Same hover behavior as toolbar buttons

**Test Case 3: Click Behavior**
1. Click recenter button
2. Expected: Slight scale-down effect, then centers view
3. Shows "View centered" feedback

**Test Case 4: Icon Clarity**
1. Look at crosshair icon
2. Expected: Clear, recognizable as centering/target icon
3. Professional appearance

## Integration Notes

### Order of Implementation

Recommended order to minimize risk:

1. **Feature 4 (Button Styling)** - Cosmetic only, low risk
2. **Feature 3 (Auto-Center)** - UX improvement, medium complexity
3. **Feature 2 (Flash Fix)** - Bug fix, simple change
4. **Feature 1 (Drag Persistence)** - Most complex, requires careful testing

### Potential Interactions

**Feature 1 + Feature 2:**
- Checkpoint system writes to RTDB during drag
- Flash fix delays `isDraggingRef` reset
- These work well together: Checkpoints during drag, smooth end

**Feature 3 + Feature 4:**
- Auto-center uses same function as button
- Button triggers same centering mechanism
- Consistent user experience

### Performance Considerations

**Feature 1 Checkpoint System:**
- Writes to RTDB every 500ms during drag
- Low overhead: ~2 writes per second
- Much less frequent than 100Hz drag stream
- RTDB can easily handle this rate

**Feature 2 Flash Fix:**
- Single 100ms setTimeout per drag end
- Negligible performance impact
- No additional renders or state changes

**Feature 3 Auto-Center:**
- Triggered only on specific events (rare)
- Single position calculation and update
- No performance concerns

**Feature 4 Button Styling:**
- Pure CSS changes
- No JavaScript overhead
- May slightly improve perceived performance (cleaner UI)

### Backward Compatibility

All features are additive or cosmetic:
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Existing drag behavior preserved
- Existing keyboard shortcuts work
- Existing functionality intact

### Testing Strategy

**Manual Testing:**
1. Test each feature individually
2. Test combinations of features
3. Test edge cases (rapid actions, network issues)
4. Test on different devices/browsers

**Key Test Scenarios:**
1. Normal drag â†’ No issues
2. Drag + disconnect â†’ Position preserved
3. Rapid successive drags â†’ No flash
4. Multiple reconnections â†’ Always centered
5. Zoom + reload â†’ Zoom preserved, position centered

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise, features can be independently rolled back:

**Feature 1:** Remove checkpoint interval code, keep rest
**Feature 2:** Remove setTimeout, revert to immediate flag reset  
**Feature 3:** Remove auto-center useEffects
**Feature 4:** Revert button styles

Each feature is self-contained and can be disabled without affecting others.
