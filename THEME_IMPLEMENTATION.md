# CollabCanvas Theme System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive light/dark theme system with smooth transitions across the entire CollabCanvas application.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Theme Infrastructure
- **ThemeContext** (`src/contexts/ThemeContext.jsx`)
  - Created centralized theme management with React Context
  - Defined comprehensive light and dark theme color palettes
  - Implemented localStorage persistence for user preference
  - Auto-updates document body background/text colors on theme change

### 2. Settings Modal
- **SettingsModal** (`src/components/Landing/SettingsModal.jsx`)
  - Beautiful modal with smooth entrance/exit animations
  - Theme toggle switch with visual feedback
  - Theme preview cards showing light/dark color schemes
  - Matches existing modal design language (ShareModal, RenameModal style)

### 3. Themed Components

#### Landing Page (`src/components/Landing/LandingPage.jsx`)
- Settings button in header (between notification bell and premium/logout buttons)
- All UI elements themed: header, project cards, filter buttons
- Confirmation modals (delete, logout) with theme support
- Smooth hover states using theme colors

#### Login/Auth (`src/components/Auth/ModernLogin.jsx`)
- Complete theming for login page
- Google and email sign-in buttons
- Input fields with proper focus/blur states
- Error messages with theme-aware styling

#### Canvas UI Components
- **ShapeToolbar** (`src/components/Canvas/ShapeToolbar.jsx`)
  - Themed toolbar with gradient buttons
  - Tooltip with theme-appropriate background
  - Dividers with conditional dark/light styling
  
- **HistoryTimeline** (`src/components/UI/HistoryTimeline.jsx`)
  - Themed timeline container and items
  - Current state highlighting
  - Empty state messaging

- **App.jsx Loading State**
  - Themed loading screen during authentication

## Theme Color Palette

### Light Theme
- **Backgrounds**: `#f5f5f5` (page), `#ffffff` (cards), `#fafafa` (elevated)
- **Text**: `#2c2e33` (primary), `#646669` (secondary), `#9ca3af` (tertiary)
- **Buttons**: `#2c2e33` (primary), `#1a1c1f` (hover)
- **Borders**: rgba-based opacity variants
- **Shadows**: Multiple elevation levels

### Dark Theme
- **Backgrounds**: `#0f1117` (page), `#1a1d24` (cards), `#23262f` (elevated)
- **Text**: `#e5e7eb` (primary), `#9ca3af` (secondary), `#6b7280` (tertiary)
- **Buttons**: `#4f46e5` (primary), `#4338ca` (hover)
- **Borders**: White opacity variants
- **Shadows**: Increased opacity for visibility

## Key Features

### Smooth Transitions
- All theme changes animate smoothly (0.3s cubic-bezier easing)
- Settings modal has entrance/exit animations
- No jarring color switches

### Persistence
- User's theme choice saved to localStorage as `collabcanvas-theme`
- Theme persists across sessions and page reloads

### Accessibility
- High contrast ratios maintained in both themes
- Clear visual feedback for interactive elements
- Proper focus states for keyboard navigation

## Usage

### For Users
1. Sign in to CollabCanvas
2. On the landing page, click the **⚙️ Settings** button in the header
3. Toggle between light and dark themes using:
   - The switch toggle
   - Or click the theme preview cards
4. Theme applies immediately across all pages

### For Developers
```jsx
import { useTheme } from '../../contexts/ThemeContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { theme, isDark, toggleTheme } = useTheme();
  
  return (
    <div style={{
      background: theme.background.card,
      color: theme.text.primary,
      border: `1px solid ${theme.border.normal}`
    }}>
      {/* component content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Components Fully Themed
✅ ThemeContext & Provider  
✅ SettingsModal  
✅ LandingPage (+ all modals)  
✅ ModernLogin  
✅ App.jsx loading state  
✅ ShapeToolbar  
✅ HistoryTimeline  

## Components With Partial/Compatible Theming
- ShareModal, RenameModal, SubscriptionModal (use similar patterns, will work reasonably in dark mode)
- LayersPanel (large component, core areas themed)
- Canvas and other complex components (will inherit body colors)

## Future Enhancements
- Theme preview in settings (live preview before applying)
- Custom theme colors
- System preference detection (auto dark mode based on OS settings)
- Theme-aware SVG icons
- More granular control over component-specific theming

## Technical Notes
- Theme values are computed on every render but are lightweight objects
- No performance impact observed with the current implementation
- Styles objects converted to functions that accept `theme` parameter
- Inline hover states updated to use theme values dynamically
- Modal backdrop blur consistent across both themes

## Testing Checklist
- ✅ Settings button appears on landing page
- ✅ Settings modal opens with smooth animation
- ✅ Theme toggle works in both directions
- ✅ Theme persists after page reload
- ✅ All themed pages respond to theme changes
- ✅ Hover states work correctly in both themes
- ✅ Text remains readable in both themes
- ✅ Borders and shadows visible in both themes
