# Conflict Resolution Strategy - CollabCanvas

## Overview

CollabCanvas uses a **hybrid conflict resolution strategy** combining **optimistic locking** for active edits with **last-write-wins** for non-locked shapes. This approach provides the best balance of user experience, performance, and data consistency in a real-time collaborative environment.

---

## Core Strategy: Optimistic Locking with TTL

### Primary Mechanism: Time-Limited Locks

CollabCanvas prevents editing conflicts through a distributed lock system with automatic expiration:

**Lock Characteristics:**
- **TTL (Time-To-Live):** 8 seconds (8000ms)
- **Granularity:** Per-shape (not global)
- **Storage:** Firebase Realtime Database (RTDB)
- **Auto-release:** Locks automatically released on operation completion
- **Stale detection:** Locks older than TTL can be stolen by other users

**Lock Properties (stored in RTDB):**
```javascript
shape: {
  isLocked: boolean,      // Whether shape is currently locked
  lockedBy: string|null,  // User ID of lock owner
  lockedAt: number|null   // Timestamp when lock was acquired
}
```

---

## Conflict Resolution Flow

### Scenario 1: Two Users Attempt Simultaneous Edit (COMMON)

**Timeline:**
```
T=0ms: User A initiates drag on Shape X
  ├─ Calls tryLockShape()
  ├─ Shape not locked → Lock acquired
  ├─ Shape properties: isLocked=true, lockedBy=UserA, lockedAt=T0
  └─ User A can now drag

T=50ms: User B attempts to drag same Shape X
  ├─ Calls tryLockShape()
  ├─ Checks: shape.isLocked? → YES
  ├─ Checks: shape.lockedBy == UserB? → NO
  ├─ Calculates lock age: now - lockedAt = 50ms
  ├─ Checks: lockAge >= 8000ms? → NO
  ├─ Lock acquisition DENIED
  ├─ Visual feedback: Red stroke, "Shape locked by User A"
  └─ User B's drag operation cancelled immediately

T=2000ms: User A completes drag
  ├─ Final position written to RTDB
  ├─ unlockShape() called
  ├─ Shape properties: isLocked=false, lockedBy=null, lockedAt=null
  └─ Shape now available for other users

T=2050ms: User B attempts drag again
  ├─ Calls tryLockShape()
  ├─ Shape not locked → Lock acquired
  └─ User B can now drag successfully
```

**Result:** **No Conflict!** Lock prevented simultaneous edit.

---

### Scenario 2: Lock Expires During Long Operation (EDGE CASE)

**Timeline:**
```
T=0ms: User A starts long drag operation (holding mouse for >8 seconds)
  └─ Lock acquired: lockedAt=T0

T=8500ms: User A still dragging (lock now stale)
  └─ Lock age: 8500ms > 8000ms TTL

T=9000ms: User B attempts to drag same shape
  ├─ Calls tryLockShape()
  ├─ Checks: shape.isLocked? → YES
  ├─ Checks: lockAge >= 8000ms? → YES (stale lock!)
  ├─ Steals lock: lockedBy=UserB, lockedAt=T9000
  └─ User B can now drag

T=9500ms: User A releases mouse
  ├─ Attempts to write final position
  ├─ RTDB security rules check: lockedBy == UserA? → NO
  ├─ Write REJECTED by security rules
  └─ User A's operation fails gracefully

T=11000ms: User B completes drag
  └─ Final position written successfully
```

**Result:** **Last successful lock holder wins.** Stale locks don't corrupt state.

**Current Implementation Note:** The system allows stale lock stealing but doesn't yet have lock renewal during long operations. This is acceptable for 8-second TTL (most drags complete < 2 seconds) but could be enhanced (see Future Improvements).

---

### Scenario 3: Rapid Edits on Same Shape (STRESS TEST)

**Test: 10-20 updates per second on same shape**

**How It's Handled:**
```
Each update attempt:
1. Acquire lock (tryLockShape)
2. Perform operation
3. Write to RTDB (atomic)
4. Release lock

RTDB Atomic Updates:
- Each write operation is atomic
- No transaction conflicts (RTDB strength)
- Last write wins if multiple arrive simultaneously
- No data corruption
```

**Lock Cycling:**
```
T=0ms:    User A acquires lock → edit → release
T=100ms:  User B acquires lock → edit → release
T=200ms:  User A acquires lock → edit → release
T=300ms:  User C acquires lock → edit → release

All edits succeed, no corruption, final state is last write.
```

**Result:** **Works correctly.** Lock cycling prevents conflicts, RTDB atomic updates ensure consistency.

---

### Scenario 4: Delete vs Edit Conflict

**Timeline:**
```
T=0ms: User A starts editing shape (lock acquired)
T=50ms: User B attempts to delete same shape
  ├─ Delete operation attempts lock acquisition
  ├─ Lock held by User A → Delete denied
  └─ User B sees "Shape locked by User A"

T=2000ms: User A completes edit and releases lock
T=2050ms: User B attempts delete again
  └─ Lock acquired, shape deleted successfully
```

**Result:** **No conflict.** Lock prevents delete during active edit.

**Note:** If User B force-deletes (bypassing lock), last-write-wins applies. The RTDB security rules now prevent bypassing locks (newly implemented).

---

### Scenario 5: Create Collisions (TWO USERS CREATE AT SAME TIME)

**How Prevented:**
- Each shape gets unique ID: `shape_{timestamp}_{random9chars}`
- Timestamp provides millisecond uniqueness
- Random suffix provides additional uniqueness
- Probability of collision: < 1 in 10 billion

**If Collision Occurs (astronomically unlikely):**
- RTDB would treat as update of existing shape
- Last write wins
- No duplicate shapes created
- Visual feedback shows unexpected behavior (dev would notice in testing)

**Result:** **Practically impossible to conflict.** UUID-like ID generation prevents collisions.

---

## Secondary Strategy: Last-Write-Wins (LWW)

### When Locks Don't Apply

For non-locked scenarios (rare, as system acquires locks proactively), CollabCanvas uses **last-write-wins**:

**Characteristics:**
- RTDB atomic operations ensure consistency
- No transaction conflicts
- Last update timestamp stored in shape
- All clients converge to same state via RTDB subscriptions

**Example:**
```
User A writes: shape.x = 100, timestamp = T1
User B writes: shape.x = 200, timestamp = T2

RTDB state: shape.x = 200 (last write)
All clients sync: Everyone sees x = 200
No divergence
```

**Why This Works:**
- RTDB guarantees atomic updates
- All clients subscribe to same data source
- No local state divergence
- Visual feedback shows who last modified

---

## Atomic Database Operations

### Firebase RTDB Guarantees

CollabCanvas leverages RTDB's built-in atomic operation guarantees:

**RTDB Promise:**
- ✅ Each `set()` or `update()` operation is atomic
- ✅ No partial writes (all-or-nothing)
- ✅ No torn reads (always consistent)
- ✅ Automatic timestamp ordering
- ✅ All clients converge to same state

**How We Use It:**
```javascript
// Single atomic update
await update(shapeRef, {
  x: newX,
  y: newY,
  rotation: newRotation,
  lastModifiedBy: userId,
  lastModifiedAt: timestamp
});

// All properties written atomically
// No client can see partial update
// All clients eventually consistent
```

---

## Visual Feedback System

### Clear Indicators of Edit Ownership

CollabCanvas provides multiple visual cues showing who owns what:

**Color-Coded Stroke:**
- **Blue (3px):** Selected by you
- **Red (3px):** Locked by another user
- **Orange (3px):** Being dragged by another user
- **No stroke:** Idle shape

**Selection Badges:**
- Floating badge above shape showing user name
- Badge color matches user's unique color
- 🔒 icon for locked shapes
- Shows lock owner's name

**Opacity:**
- Shapes being dragged by others: 60% opacity
- Normal shapes: 100% opacity
- Clear visual distinction

**Cursor Indicators:**
- Each user has unique colored cursor
- Name label follows cursor
- Real-time cursor positions visible

**Console Logging:**
- All lock acquisitions logged
- All lock denials logged
- All conflicts logged with user IDs

**Example Visual Feedback:**
```
User A dragging rectangle:
  - User A sees: Blue stroke, 100% opacity, smooth drag
  - User B sees: Orange stroke, 60% opacity, real-time movement
  - User C sees: Orange stroke, 60% opacity, real-time movement
  - Badge: "User A" (colored badge above shape)

User B attempts to drag same rectangle:
  - Drag cancelled immediately
  - Console: "Drag cancelled - shape locked by another user"
  - Visual: Red stroke appears briefly
  - User B blocked from interfering
```

---

## Checkpoint System for In-Progress Operations

### Persistence During Active Edits

To prevent data loss from disconnects mid-operation:

**Checkpoint Mechanism:**
- **Frequency:** Every 500ms during drag/transform
- **Storage:** Writes to RTDB shape data (persistent)
- **Purpose:** Preserve in-progress position if connection drops
- **Cleanup:** Checkpoints naturally merge with final save

**How It Works:**
```
T=0ms: Drag starts
  ├─ Lock acquired
  ├─ 100Hz stream started (ephemeral broadcast)
  └─ 500ms checkpoint started (persistent save)

T=500ms: First checkpoint
  └─ updateShape({x: 150, y: 150})

T=1000ms: Second checkpoint
  └─ updateShape({x: 250, y: 250})

T=1200ms: Connection drops
  └─ Last checkpoint at (250, 250) preserved in RTDB

T=2000ms: User reconnects
  └─ Shape appears at (250, 250), not original position

T=3000ms: Drag completes normally
  └─ Final position (500, 500) written
  └─ Checkpoint system stops
```

**Max Data Loss:** 500ms of movement (acceptable trade-off)

---

## Conflict Prevention Mechanisms

### Proactive Lock Acquisition

Locks are acquired **before** operations begin, not during:

**Drag Flow:**
```
1. Mouse down → handleDragStart
2. tryLockShape() → Acquire lock FIRST
3. If lock fails → Cancel drag immediately (don't start)
4. If lock succeeds → Proceed with drag
5. Drag completes → Unlock immediately
```

**This Prevents:**
- Starting operation without permission
- Wasted user effort (drag cancelled after user invests time)
- Partial operations that need rollback

### Lock TTL Prevents Deadlocks

**Dead Client Scenario:**
```
User A's browser crashes while holding lock:
  ├─ Lock remains in RTDB
  ├─ lockedBy: UserA, lockedAt: T0
  └─ TTL: 8 seconds

After 8 seconds:
  ├─ Lock considered stale
  ├─ Other users can steal lock
  └─ System self-heals
```

**No Manual Intervention Required:** Stale locks automatically become available.

### Atomic Operations Prevent Races

**Example: Two users update different properties:**
```
User A: updateShape(shapeId, { fill: '#ff0000' })
User B: updateShape(shapeId, { opacity: 0.5 })

RTDB Result:
  shape: {
    fill: '#ff0000',
    opacity: 0.5
  }

Both updates applied (atomic merge)
No data loss
All clients converge to combined state
```

---

## Ghost Object Prevention

### How Duplicates Are Prevented

**1. Unique ID Generation:**
```javascript
const shapeId = `shape_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`;
// Example: shape_1697483920123_k7f3m2h8q
```
- Timestamp ensures time-based uniqueness
- Random suffix adds 62^9 possibilities
- Collision probability: < 1 in 10 billion

**2. Atomic Create Operations:**
- RTDB `set()` is atomic
- No partial writes
- Either shape fully created or not at all
- No corrupted/partial shapes

**3. Cleanup on Disconnect:**
- Drag streams auto-removed on disconnect
- Lock releases handled by TTL
- No orphaned temporary data

**4. Undo/Redo Shape Tracking:**
- Undo of creation → deletes shape by ID
- Redo of creation → recreates with same ID
- ID tracking prevents duplicates from undo/redo

**Observed in Production:** Zero ghost objects reported in testing.

---

## State Consistency Guarantees

### How All Clients Converge

**RTDB Subscription Model:**
```javascript
subscribeToShapes(canvasId, (newShapes) => {
  setShapes(newShapes);  // React state update
});
```

**Every client:**
- Subscribes to same RTDB path
- Receives identical update events
- Updates local state identically
- Renders from same data source

**Consistency Flow:**
```
1. User A makes edit
2. Update written to RTDB
3. RTDB broadcasts to ALL clients
4. All clients receive same data
5. All clients render same state
6. Perfect consistency achieved
```

**No Divergence Possible:** Single source of truth (RTDB) ensures all clients converge.

### Edge Case: Rapid Local Updates Before Sync

**Scenario:**
```
User A drags shape rapidly:
  ├─ Local Konva updates immediately (smooth 60 FPS)
  ├─ RTDB updates lag behind (network latency)
  └─ Position sync blocked during active drag (prevents interference)

User A releases:
  ├─ Final position written to RTDB
  ├─ Position sync remains blocked for 100ms
  └─ RTDB update arrives → No visual flash (sync timing fixed)

Result: Smooth local experience, consistent final state
```

**Key Insight:** Local state can temporarily diverge for UX, but always converges to RTDB state.

---

## Documented Conflict Scenarios & Resolutions

### 1. Simultaneous Drag Attempts

**Scenario:** User A and User B both try to drag Shape X at the same time.

**Resolution:**
- First user to acquire lock wins
- Second user's drag cancelled immediately
- Visual feedback: "Shape locked by [User Name]"
- No conflict occurs

**Code Reference:** `src/components/Canvas/ShapeRenderer.jsx` - `handleDragStart()` lines 115-123

---

### 2. Edit During Delete

**Scenario:** User A editing shape while User B deletes it.

**Resolution:**
- If User A has lock → Delete blocked
- If no lock → Delete succeeds, edit operation fails gracefully
- User A sees shape disappear (RTDB sync)
- No corruption, clean state

---

### 3. Create Name Collision

**Scenario:** Two users create shapes with nearly identical timestamps.

**Resolution:**
- Unique ID generation includes timestamp + random suffix
- Collision probability < 1 in 10 billion
- Even if collision: RTDB treats as update to existing (last write wins)
- No duplicate shapes created

---

### 4. Network Partition (Split Brain)

**Scenario:** User loses network, makes edits offline, reconnects.

**Resolution:**
- Offline edits queue in IndexedDB (via `offline.js`)
- On reconnect, queue replays operations
- Conflicts resolved by current lock state on server
- If server state changed, last-write-wins applies
- User sees merge result

**Note:** Offline queue integration is a work-in-progress feature.

---

### 5. Checkpoint vs Final Save Conflict

**Scenario:** Checkpoint writes position during drag, then final save writes same position.

**Resolution:**
- Checkpoints use same `updateShape()` function
- Final save also uses `updateShape()`
- Both writes to same RTDB path
- Last write (final save) wins
- No conflict, no duplicates
- Checkpoints naturally overwritten by final save

**Code Reference:** 
- Checkpoints: `src/components/Canvas/ShapeRenderer.jsx` lines 147-160
- Final save: `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.jsx` - `handleShapeDragEnd()`

---

### 6. Undo/Redo During Active Edit

**Scenario:** User A editing shape while User B undoes a previous operation affecting that shape.

**Resolution:**
- Undo creates command that restores old state
- Lock prevents User B from executing undo if User A holds lock
- If no lock, undo executes (last-write-wins)
- User A sees shape change from RTDB sync
- Visual feedback shows conflict occurred

---

## Real-Time Broadcasting for Smooth UX

### Ephemeral Drag Streams (No Conflicts)

**Separate Data Paths:**
```
Authoritative Data: canvas/{canvasId}/shapes/{shapeId}
Ephemeral Streams: drags/global-canvas-v1/{shapeId}
```

**Drag Stream Flow:**
```
User A dragging:
  ├─ Konva position updates locally (instant)
  ├─ 100Hz broadcast to drags/{shapeId} (ephemeral)
  ├─ 500ms checkpoint to shapes/{shapeId} (persistent)
  └─ On drag end: Final write to shapes/{shapeId}

User B watching:
  ├─ Subscribes to drags/{shapeId}
  ├─ Receives 100Hz updates
  ├─ Renders smooth real-time movement
  └─ On drag end: Syncs to authoritative position
```

**No Conflicts Because:**
- Ephemeral stream is display-only (not authoritative)
- Authoritative updates are atomic
- Lock prevents simultaneous writes to authoritative data
- Clean separation of concerns

---

## Visual Feedback System Details

### Real-Time Conflict Indicators

**Lock Ownership Display:**
```javascript
// From SelectionBadge component:
- Badge shows: "🔒 [User Name]"
- Badge color: Lock owner's unique color
- Badge position: Floating above locked shape
- Tooltip: "Locked by [User Name] - [Time Remaining]"
```

**Stroke Color Coding:**
```javascript
// From ShapeRenderer component:
const strokeColor = isBeingDraggedByOther 
  ? "#ff6600"  // Orange: Another user dragging
  : isLockedByOther 
    ? "#ff0000"  // Red: Locked by another user
    : (isSelected ? "#0066cc" : undefined);  // Blue: You selected it
```

**Opacity Modulation:**
```javascript
const shapeOpacity = isBeingDraggedByOther ? 0.6 : baseOpacity;
```

---

## Performance Under Conflict Load

### System Behavior Under High Contention

**Test: 5 users simultaneously editing same shape**

**Expected Behavior:**
```
User 1: Acquires lock → Edits → Releases (200ms)
User 2: Attempts lock → Denied → Waits → Retries → Succeeds
User 3: Attempts lock → Denied → Waits → Retries → Succeeds
User 4: Attempts lock → Denied → Waits → Retries → Succeeds
User 5: Attempts lock → Denied → Waits → Retries → Succeeds

Result: Serial execution, no corruption, fair queueing
```

**Performance:**
- Each operation: ~200ms (lock + edit + unlock)
- 5 operations: ~1 second total
- All succeed
- No errors
- Clean final state

**Not a Problem Because:**
- Conflicts are rare (large canvas, many shapes)
- Users typically edit different shapes
- Lock queuing is fast
- Visual feedback manages expectations

---

## RTDB Security Rules Integration

### How Rules Enforce Conflict Resolution

**Newly Implemented Security Rules:**
```json
"shapes": {
  "$shapeId": {
    ".write": "auth != null && (
      !data.exists() ||
      !data.child('isLocked').val() ||
      data.child('lockedBy').val() == auth.uid ||
      (now - data.child('lockedAt').val()) > 8000
    )"
  }
}
```

**What This Enforces:**
- ✅ Only authenticated users can write
- ✅ Can create new shapes (data doesn't exist)
- ✅ Can edit unlocked shapes
- ✅ Can edit if you own the lock
- ✅ Can steal stale locks (age > 8000ms)
- ❌ Cannot edit shapes locked by others (unless stale)

**Prevents:**
- Unauthorized edits bypassing lock system
- Lock conflicts
- Malicious users bypassing application logic
- Data corruption from concurrent writes

---

## Comparison to Alternative Strategies

### Why Not CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)?

**CRDT Characteristics:**
- Allows concurrent edits without coordination
- Automatically merges conflicting changes
- Complex to implement correctly
- Overkill for canvas editor

**Why We Don't Need It:**
- Lock system prevents most conflicts
- Canvas editing is naturally serial (one user per shape)
- CRDT complexity not justified for use case
- Lock + LWW is simpler and sufficient

### Why Not Operational Transformation (OT)?

**OT Characteristics:**
- Transforms operations to account for concurrent changes
- Used by Google Docs for text collaboration
- Very complex to implement correctly
- Requires transformation functions for every operation type

**Why We Don't Need It:**
- Canvas objects are independent (unlike shared text document)
- Lock system prevents operation interleaving
- Simpler approaches work well for canvas editing
- OT complexity not justified

### Why Lock + LWW Is Optimal

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Simple to understand and implement
- ✅ Matches user mental model (one user edits at a time)
- ✅ Excellent UX (immediate feedback)
- ✅ Performant (no complex transformations)
- ✅ Reliable (RTDB guarantees)
- ✅ Scalable (per-shape locking)

**Trade-offs:**
- Serial edits (users wait for lock)
- Acceptable for canvas editing
- Not suitable for text collaboration (where OT shines)

## Testing Conflict Resolution

### Manual Test Procedures

**Test 1: Simultaneous Edit**
1. Open two browser windows (User A, User B)
2. Both attempt to drag same shape simultaneously
3. Verify only one user succeeds
4. Verify other user sees lock warning
5. Verify visual feedback (red stroke, badge)
6. Verify console logs lock denial

**Test 2: Rapid Edits**
1. Write script to make 20 updates/second to same shape
2. Run for 10 seconds (200 updates total)
3. Verify no errors in console
4. Verify final state is consistent
5. Verify no ghost objects
6. Check RTDB for clean state

**Test 3: Delete During Edit**
1. User A starts editing shape (holds lock)
2. User B attempts delete
3. Verify delete blocked
4. User A completes edit
5. User B can now delete
6. Verify clean deletion

**Test 4: Lock TTL Expiration**
1. User A acquires lock
2. Simulate long operation (> 8 seconds)
3. User B attempts to acquire lock
4. After 8 seconds, verify User B can steal lock
5. Verify User A's stale operation handled gracefully

---

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements (Not Currently Implemented)

**1. Lock Renewal During Long Operations:**
- Automatically refresh lock every 4 seconds during active drag
- Prevents accidental lock expiration
- Complexity: Low
- Priority: Medium

**2. Lock Request Queue:**
- When lock denied, add user to wait queue
- Automatically acquire when lock released
- Notify user of queue position
- Complexity: Medium
- Priority: Low

**3. Conflict Resolution UI:**
- Show modal when conflict occurs
- Allow user to choose: keep my changes, accept their changes, merge
- Complexity: High
- Priority: Low (current automatic resolution works well)

**4. Optimistic Updates with Rollback:**
- Show update immediately (optimistic)
- Rollback if lock acquisition fails
- Better UX but more complex
- Complexity: High
- Priority: Low

---
