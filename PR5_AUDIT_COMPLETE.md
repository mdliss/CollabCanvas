## Gap Detection Results

### GAP FOUND: Delete Key Did Not Check Locks ❌

**Discovery:**
- `deleteShape` function in `canvas.js` lacked lock enforcement
- Allowed any user to delete locked shapes via Delete/Backspace key
- Violated PRD §4-§5 requirement: "Cannot delete shapes locked by other users"

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// canvas.js:164-189
export const deleteShape = async (canvasId, shapeId, user) => {
  // Check if shape is locked by another user
  const shapeToDelete = shapes.find(s => s.id === shapeId);
  if (shapeToDelete && shapeToDelete.isLocked && shapeToDelete.lockedBy !== user?.uid) {
    console.warn("[deleteShape] Cannot delete - shape locked by another user", shapeId);
    throw new Error(`Shape is locked by another user`);
  }
  // ... proceed with delete
}

// Canvas.jsx:67-77
const handleKeyDown = async (e) => {
  if ((e.key === "Delete" || e.key === "Backspace") && selectedId) {
    try {
      await deleteShape(CANVAS_ID, selectedId, user);
      setSelectedId(null);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("[Canvas] Delete failed:", error.message);
      setLastError(error.message); // Shows in DebugNote overlay
    }
  }
};
```

**Evidence:** Commit 773516a

## Implementation Verification (Static Analysis)

### ✅ Lock Acquisition
- **Function:** `tryLockShape(canvasId, shapeId, userId, ttlMs=4000)`
- **Location:** `canvas.js:197-244`
- **Verification:**
  ```javascript
  if (!shape.isLocked || lockExpired || shape.lockedBy === userId) {
    // Acquire lock
    lockAcquired = true;
    return { ...shape, isLocked: true, lockedBy: userId, lockedAt: now };
  }
  ```
- **Evidence:** ✅ First-touch locking with 4s TTL

### ✅ Lock Release
- **Function:** `unlockShape(canvasId, shapeId, userId)`
- **Location:** `canvas.js:255-293`
- **Verification:**
  ```javascript
  if (shape.lockedBy === userId) {
    return { ...shape, isLocked: false, lockedBy: null, lockedAt: null };
  }
  ```
- **Evidence:** ✅ Only lock owner can release

### ✅ Stale Lock Sweeper
- **Function:** `staleLockSweeper(canvasId, ttlMs=5000)`
- **Location:** `canvas.js:300-337`
- **Wiring:** `Canvas.jsx:194-211`
- **Verification:**
  ```javascript
  // Runs every 2 seconds
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    staleLockSweeper(CANVAS_ID);
  }, 2000);
  
  // Runs on visibility change
  document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
  ```
- **Evidence:** ✅ Automatic cleanup every 2s + on tab return

### ✅ Lock Guards on Operations
- **updateShape:** `canvas.js:129-131`
  ```javascript
  if (shape.isLocked && shape.lockedBy !== user?.uid) {
    console.warn("[updateShape] Shape locked by another user", shapeId);
    return shape; // Skip update
  }
  ```
- **deleteShape:** `canvas.js:178-181` (NEW FIX)
  ```javascript
  if (shapeToDelete && shapeToDelete.isLocked && shapeToDelete.lockedBy !== user?.uid) {
    throw new Error(`Shape is locked by another user`);
  }
  ```
- **Evidence:** ✅ Both operations respect locks

### ✅ Lock Badges (Visual Feedback)
- **Location:** `Canvas.jsx:265-292`
- **Verification:**
  ```javascript
  const isLockedByOther = shape.isLocked && shape.lockedBy && shape.lockedBy !== user?.uid;
  
  if (selection || isLockedByOther) {
    if (isLockedByOther) {
      const lockOwner = onlineUsers.find(u => u.uid === shape.lockedBy);
      badgeName = lockOwner ? `🔒 ${lockOwner.displayName}` : "🔒 Locked";
      badgeColor = lockOwner?.color || "#ff0000";
    }
    return <SelectionBadge ... />;
  }
  ```
- **Evidence:** ✅ All users see lock owner name

### ✅ Shape Drag Lock Integration
- **Location:** `Canvas.jsx:150-153, 256-260`
- **Shape.jsx:** Already has `onRequestLock` handler (lines 24-38)
- **Verification:**
  ```javascript
  // Canvas passes handler
  const handleRequestLock = async (shapeId) => {
    if (!user?.uid) return false;
    return await tryLockShape(CANVAS_ID, shapeId, user.uid);
  };
  
  <Shape ... onRequestLock={handleRequestLock} currentUserId={user?.uid} />
  ```
- **Evidence:** ✅ Lock acquisition on drag start

### ✅ Cleanup Paths
- **Presence:** `usePresence.js:31` → `setUserOffline(uid)` on unmount
- **Cursors:** `useCursors.js:59` → `clearCursor(uid)` on unmount
- **RTDB:** `presence.js:37-40` → `onDisconnect().update({ online:false, cursorX:null, cursorY:null })`
- **Evidence:** ✅ Full cleanup on disconnect

## Manual Testing Protocol

**Status:** 🔜 REQUIRED BEFORE MERGING

I cannot execute two-browser tests autonomously. The complete testing protocol is documented in:

📄 **`VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md`** (332 lines)

### Tests Required:
- [ ] **Test A:** Lock enforcement during drag
- [ ] **Test B:** Lock blocks delete key ← NEW (validates fix)
- [ ] **Test C:** Stale lock cleanup (disconnect)
- [ ] **Test D:** Stale lock cleanup (timeout)
- [ ] **Test E:** Cursor sync <50ms
- [ ] **Test F:** Presence count accuracy

### How to Run:
```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev

# Browser Window A (Chrome)
http://localhost:5173
Login as: user-a@test.com

# Browser Window B (Chrome Incognito or Firefox)
http://localhost:5173
Login as: user-b@test.com

# Follow VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md steps
# Record evidence for each test
```

---

## Evidence Collection Template

After manual testing, add to `tasks.md`:

```markdown
**PR Checklist:**

- [x] User A starts dragging shape → shape locks for User A
  → evidence: Test A passes; tryLockShape returns true; badge shows "🔒 User A" in Window B
     | 2025-01-14 | feature/realtime-sync@773516a | VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md Test A

- [x] Cannot delete shapes locked by other users
  → evidence: Test B passes; Delete key in Window B shows error "Shape is locked by another user"
     | 2025-01-14 | feature/realtime-sync@773516a | VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md Test B

- [x] Lock releases after timeout (5 seconds) via staleLockSweeper
  → evidence: Test D passes; staleLockSweeper cleans locks after 5s; console shows "Cleaned 1 stale locks"
     | 2025-01-14 | feature/realtime-sync@773516a | VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md Test D
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Manual Testing)
1. Run all tests in `VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md`
2. Record evidence for each test
3. Update `tasks.md` with evidence lines
4. If any test fails → revert 773516a and report

### After Tests Pass
5. Push branch: `git push -u origin feature/realtime-sync`
6. Create PR: "PR #5: Realtime sync + locking + badges (verified)"
7. PR body: Copy evidence bullets from tasks.md
8. Request review

### PR #8 Preparation (If Tests Pass)
```bash
npm i -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event jsdom
```

Create test placeholders:
- `tests/unit/services/canvas.test.js` → Lock functions
- `tests/integration/multiplayer.test.js` → Two-user scenarios
- Do NOT over-scope

## Diagnostic Logs to Watch

When running manual tests, look for:

### Success Patterns:
```
[tryLockShape] Starting... {shapeId} {uid}
[tryLockShape] Success {shapeId}
[unlockShape] Success {shapeId}
[staleLockSweeper] Cleaned N stale locks
[deleteShape] Success {shapeId}
```

### Expected Blocks:
```
[tryLockShape] Already locked by {other-uid}
[deleteShape] Cannot delete - shape locked by another user
[Shape] Drag cancelled - shape locked by another user
```

---

## Fail-Safe

If any manual test fails:
```bash
git revert 773516a  # Revert deleteShape fix
git revert cfab03d  # Revert lock wiring
# Report failing test details
```

Do NOT mark tasks.md items complete until all tests pass.
