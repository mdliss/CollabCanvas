## Comprehensive Testing Checklist

### Basic Upload Flow

- [ ] **Open account dropdown** (click avatar at top-center)
- [ ] **Hover over profile picture** â†’ "Change" overlay appears
- [ ] **Click profile picture** â†’ file picker opens
- [ ] **Select image** (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, or `.webp` under 5MB)
- [ ] **Watch upload state** â†’ Icon changes to "Uploading..."
- [ ] **Verify avatar updates** in dropdown (1-3 seconds)
- [ ] **Check avatar in cursor label** (move mouse on canvas)
- [ ] **Check avatar in presence list** (upper-right corner)
- [ ] **Refresh page** â†’ new avatar persists

### Console Verification

**Open browser console** (Cmd + Option + J on Mac, F12 on Windows)

Expected logs during upload:
```
[AuthBar] Profile picture updated: https://firebasestorage...
[profilePicture] Uploading image for user: abc123...
[profilePicture] Upload complete, getting download URL...
[profilePicture] Download URL: https://firebasestorage...
[profilePicture] Profile updated successfully
```

### Error Handling

- [ ] **Try uploading non-image file** (`.txt`, `.pdf`)
  - Expected: File picker should block it (accept filter)
  
- [ ] **Try uploading 10MB image**
  - Expected: Alert shows "Image must be less than 5MB"
  
- [ ] **Click "Cancel" in file picker**
  - Expected: Nothing happens, no error

### Old Photo Cleanup

- [ ] **Upload first photo** â†’ Check Firebase Storage console
- [ ] **Upload second photo** â†’ Old photo should be deleted
- [ ] **Verify Storage console** shows only latest photo

**Firebase Storage Console:**
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/collabcanvas-99a09/storage
```

Expected path: `/profile-pictures/{userId}/{timestamp}.jpg`

### Multi-User Testing

- [ ] **Upload photo in Browser A** (e.g., Chrome)
- [ ] **Open Browser B** (e.g., Firefox) with different user
- [ ] **Verify Browser B sees Browser A's new avatar** in PresenceList
- [ ] **Click Browser A's user in PresenceList** (Browser B)
- [ ] **Verify profile popup shows correct photo**

### Edge Cases

- [ ] **Upload photo twice rapidly**
  - Expected: Both succeed, only latest photo in Storage
  
- [ ] **Sign out and sign back in**
  - Expected: Photo persists
  
- [ ] **Upload photo, close browser immediately**
  - Expected: Upload completes (async), photo persists on reopen
  
- [ ] **Network interruption during upload**
  - Expected: Error alert, can retry

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Missing or insufficient permissions"

**Solution:** Ensure Firebase Storage is initialized and rules are deployed:
```bash
firebase deploy --only storage
```

Verify in console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/collabcanvas-99a09/storage

---

### Issue: Upload succeeds but avatar doesn't update

**Check:**
1. Open Firestore console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/collabcanvas-99a09/firestore
2. Navigate to `users/{your-uid}`
3. Verify `photoURL` field has the new Storage URL (starts with `https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com`)

**If photoURL is not updating:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you're signed in (check `user.uid` exists)

---

### Issue: Old photos pile up in Storage

**This should not happen!** The code includes `deleteProfilePicture()` which runs before each upload.

**Verify:**
1. Check `AuthBar.jsx` line 113: `replaceProfilePicture(user.uid, file, oldPhotoURL)`
2. Check `profilePicture.js` line 108: `deleteProfilePicture(oldPhotoURL)`

**Manual cleanup if needed:**
```javascript
// In browser console (while signed in):
import { deleteProfilePicture } from './services/profilePicture';
deleteProfilePicture('https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/...');
```

---

### Issue: Hover overlay doesn't show "Change" text

**Check CSS:**
The hover effect is inline styled. If it's not working:

1. Inspect the avatar button element (line 407-446 in `AuthBar.jsx`)
2. Verify the hover overlay `<span>` has opacity transition
3. Try a hard refresh (Cmd + Shift + R)

**Current hover effect location:** `AuthBar.jsx` lines 428-444

---

### Issue: Images are too large and slow to load

**Future optimization** (not critical for MVP):
- Add client-side image compression before upload
- Resize to optimal 256Ã—256px
- Use image cropping tool

**For now:** User's responsibility to upload reasonable-sized images (max 5MB enforced)

---

## Performance Testing

### Storage Costs

**Current state:** No optimization, stores full-resolution uploads

**Monitor usage:**
- Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/collabcanvas-99a09/storage
- Free tier: 5GB storage, 1GB/day download

**Expected usage:**
- 10 users Ã— 2MB avg = 20MB storage
- 100 users Ã— 2MB avg = 200MB storage
- 1000 users Ã— 2MB avg = 2GB storage

Old photos auto-deleted, so storage = current active users Ã— avg file size.

---

### Load Time Testing

**Test with slow 3G connection:**

1. Open Chrome DevTools â†’ Network tab
2. Select "Slow 3G" throttling
3. Upload 5MB image
4. Expected: 30-60 seconds upload time (acceptable for MVP)

**Desktop/WiFi:**
- 1MB image â†’ ~1-2 seconds
- 5MB image â†’ ~3-5 seconds

---

## Security Verification

### Storage Rules

**Verify rules in console:**
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/collabcanvas-99a09/storage/rules

**Expected rules:**
```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /profile-pictures/{userId}/{filename} {
      // Users can only upload to their own folder
      allow write: if request.auth != null 
                   && request.auth.uid == userId
                   && request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024
                   && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
      
      // Any authenticated user can read profile pictures
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

**Test security:**

1. **Try uploading to another user's folder** (manual test in console):
   - Expected: Permission denied
   
2. **Try uploading 10MB file:**
   - Expected: Client validates, server rejects if bypassed
   
3. **Try uploading non-image:**
   - Expected: Client validates, server rejects if bypassed
