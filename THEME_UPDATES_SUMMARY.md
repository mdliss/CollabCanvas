# Theme System Updates - Issue Fixes

## Issues Fixed (October 18, 2025)

### 1. âœ… Filter Button Hover States (All/Owned/Shared)
**Problem**: Buttons stayed white after hover in dark mode
**Fix**: Updated all filter buttons in `LandingPage.jsx` to use theme-aware hover states
- Now uses `theme.background.elevated` on hover
- Properly reverts to `theme.background.card` on mouse leave
- Border colors also theme-aware

### 2. âœ… Sign Out Button Hover State
**Problem**: Same white hover issue
**Fix**: Updated sign out button with proper theme-based hover colors

### 3. âœ… Projects Button (Canvas)
**Problem**: Didn't change color with theme
**Fix**: Updated in `Canvas.jsx` (line 2983-3018)
- Background: `theme.background.card`
- Text: `theme.text.primary`
- Border: `theme.border.normal`
- Hover states properly themed

### 4. âœ… Canvas Grid Color
**Problem**: Grid stayed light gray in dark mode
**Fix**: Made grid color theme-aware in `Canvas.jsx`
- Light mode: `#e0e0e0` (original)
- Dark mode: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)` (subtle white lines)
- Dynamically updates based on theme

### 5. âœ… Added Additional Color Themes
**Problem**: Only had Light and Dark
**Fix**: Added 3 new themes in `ThemeContext.jsx`
- **Midnight**: Deep blue theme with indigo accents
- **Ocean**: Teal/cyan theme with ocean-inspired colors
- **Forest**: Green theme with emerald accents
- Total: **5 themes** (Light, Dark, Midnight, Ocean, Forest)

### 6. âœ… Removed Emoji from Settings
**Problem**: Emoji next to "Appearance" wasn't desired
**Fix**: Removed ðŸŽ¨ emoji from `SettingsModal.jsx`

### 7. âœ… Theme Selection Speed
**Problem**: Clicking theme preview boxes was slower than toggle
**Fix**: Completely redesigned theme selection in `SettingsModal.jsx`
- Removed toggle switch
- Theme selection is now **instant** on click
- Shows all 5 themes in a grid (2 columns)
- Active theme has checkmark indicator
- Hover effects with scale animation
- Each theme shows 3-color preview

## Updated Components

### Modified Files
1. `src/contexts/ThemeContext.jsx` - Added 3 new themes + improved API
2. `src/components/Landing/SettingsModal.jsx` - Redesigned with theme grid
3. `src/components/Landing/LandingPage.jsx` - Fixed hover states
4. `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.jsx` - Themed Projects button + grid

### Theme System API
```jsx
const { 
  theme,           // Current theme object
  currentThemeId,  // 'light' | 'dark' | 'midnight' | 'ocean' | 'forest'
  setTheme,        // Set theme by ID (instant)
  toggleTheme,     // Toggle light/dark (backward compat)
  availableThemes  // Array of all theme objects
} = useTheme();
```

## New Theme Previews

**Light**: White/gray - Original clean design
**Dark**: Charcoal - Professional dark mode
**Midnight**: Deep blue/indigo - Night-focused theme
**Ocean**: Teal/cyan - Calm ocean-inspired
**Forest**: Deep green/emerald - Nature-inspired

All themes include:
- Consistent component styling
- Proper contrast ratios
- Smooth transitions
- Shadow adjustments for visibility

## What Still Works

- âœ… Theme persistence (localStorage)
- âœ… Smooth transitions on theme change
- âœ… All modals properly themed
- âœ… Canvas UI elements themed
- âœ… Login/Auth pages themed
- âœ… Landing page fully themed
- âœ… History timeline themed
- âœ… Shape toolbar themed
- âœ… Layers panel compatible

## Notes

**Online Users (Presence List)**: Uses Avatar component which generates dynamic user colors - these are intentionally user-specific and don't theme (for user identification)

**AI Component Buttons**: AICanvas and AIDesignSuggestions components manage their own internal styling and will inherit body background colors. If specific buttons need theming, those components can import `useTheme()` independently.
