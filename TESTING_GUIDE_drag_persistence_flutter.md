2. **Window A:** Drag rectangle toward (2000, 2000)
3. **Window A:** While mouse still down, at approximately (1500, 1500):
   - Press Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
   - Hard refresh forces cache clear
4. **Window A:** Wait for page to reload completely

## Debugging Failed Tests

### If Drag Persistence Fails:

1. **Check checkpoint interval:**
   - Open console during drag
   - Look for checkpoint warnings
   - Verify 500ms frequency

2. **Check RTDB writes:**
   - DevTools → Network → WS
   - Confirm writes happening
   - Verify path: `canvases/<id>/shapes/<shapeId>`

3. **Check disconnect cleanup:**
   - Does drag stream clear?
   - Is checkpoint interval cleared?

### If Flutter Appears:

1. **Check timing:**
   - Add console.log in handleDragEnd
   - Log when isDraggingRef cleared
   - Verify 100ms delay present

2. **Check position sync:**
   - Add console.log in position sync effect
   - Verify it doesn't run during 100ms window
   - Confirm props match Konva state after

3. **Check RTDB latency:**
   - DevTools → Network
   - Measure RTDB write time
   - If > 200ms, may need longer delay
