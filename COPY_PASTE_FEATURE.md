# Copy & Paste Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Full copy/paste functionality has been implemented with keyboard shortcuts, undo/redo support, and automatic batching for multiple shapes.

## Features

### 1. ðŸ“‹ Copy Selected Shapes
- **Shortcut:** `Cmd/Ctrl + C`
- **Behavior:**
  - Copies all currently selected shapes
  - Shows feedback: "Copied X shape(s)"
  - Stores complete shape data in memory
  - Can copy single or multiple shapes

### 2. ðŸ“Œ Paste Shapes
- **Shortcut:** `Cmd/Ctrl + V`
- **Behavior:**
  - Pastes previously copied shapes
  - Shows feedback: "Pasted X shape(s)"
  - Creates new shapes with:
    - New unique IDs
    - 20-pixel offset from original (so you can see them)
    - Fresh timestamps
    - No locks (not locked)
  - **Automatically selects pasted shapes** for immediate editing
  - **Fully integrated with undo/redo system**

### 3. ðŸ”„ Undo/Redo Support
- Paste operations are fully undoable
- Shows "Created shape" in history (or batch entry if multiple)
- Can revert to before paste
- Can redo paste after undo

### 4. ðŸ“¦ Smart Batching
- Pasting **multiple shapes** creates **one history entry**
  - Example: Paste 10 shapes â†’ "Pasted 10 shapes" (1 entry, not 10)
- Pasting **single shape** creates individual entry
  - Example: Paste 1 shape â†’ "Created shape" (1 entry)

### 5. ðŸ“š Help Menu Documentation
- Updated help menu (press `H`) shows:
  - `Cmd/Ctrl + C` - Copy selected shape(s)
  - `Cmd/Ctrl + V` - Paste copied shape(s)
  - `Cmd/Ctrl + Z` - Undo last action
  - `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z` - Redo last undone action

## How It Works

### Copy Process
1. User selects one or more shapes
2. User presses `Cmd/Ctrl + C`
3. System stores complete shape data (all properties preserved)
4. Feedback notification appears
5. Shapes remain in clipboard until new copy

### Paste Process
1. User presses `Cmd/Ctrl + V` (must have copied shapes first)
2. System creates new shapes with:
   - All properties from original (color, size, rotation, gradients, etc.)
   - New unique ID
   - Position offset by 20px x and y
   - Current timestamp
   - Current user as creator
   - No lock status
3. If multiple shapes, batches into single history entry
4. New shapes are automatically selected
5. Can be immediately moved, edited, or pasted again

### Undo Paste
1. User presses `Cmd/Ctrl + Z`
2. All pasted shapes are deleted
3. Canvas returns to state before paste
4. Can redo with `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z`

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Copy and Paste Single Shape
```
1. Create a blue circle
2. Select it (click on it)
3. Press Cmd/Ctrl + C â†’ "Copied 1 shape"
4. Press Cmd/Ctrl + V â†’ "Pasted 1 shape"
   - New circle appears 20px down and right
   - New circle is selected (can immediately move it)
5. Press Cmd/Ctrl + Z â†’ Undo paste (new circle disappears)
```

### Example 2: Copy and Paste Multiple Shapes
```
1. Create 5 shapes and arrange them nicely
2. Drag to select all 5 (or Shift+click each)
3. Press Cmd/Ctrl + C â†’ "Copied 5 shapes"
4. Press Cmd/Ctrl + V â†’ "Pasted 5 shapes"
   - All 5 shapes duplicated with offset
   - All 5 pasted shapes are selected
   - History shows: "Pasted 5 shapes" (1 entry!)
5. Press Cmd/Ctrl + V again â†’ Paste another set
   - Now you have 15 total shapes (original 5 + 2 pastes)
```

### Example 3: Copy, Move, Paste
```
1. Create a red rectangle
2. Select and copy it (Cmd/Ctrl + C)
3. Move original rectangle somewhere else
4. Paste (Cmd/Ctrl + V)
   - Pasted shape appears 20px from where you copied it
   - Original position is remembered from copy time
```

### Example 4: Copy Shape with Gradient
```
1. Create circle
2. Apply gradient to it (blue to purple)
3. Rotate it 45Â°
4. Copy (Cmd/Ctrl + C)
5. Paste (Cmd/Ctrl + V)
   - New circle has exact same gradient
   - New circle has same 45Â° rotation
   - All properties preserved perfectly
```

## What Gets Copied

When you copy shapes, **everything** is preserved:

âœ… **Position** (x, y)  
âœ… **Size** (width, height, radius)  
âœ… **Rotation**  
âœ… **Scale** (scaleX, scaleY)  
âœ… **Color** (solid fill or gradient)  
âœ… **Opacity**  
âœ… **Gradients** (all gradient properties)  
âœ… **Stroke** (color and width)  
âœ… **Text** (content and formatting)  
âœ… **Shape type** (rectangle, circle, etc.)  
âœ… **All other custom properties**  

## What Gets Reset on Paste

ðŸ”„ **ID** - New unique ID generated  
ðŸ”„ **Position** - Offset by 20px from original  
ðŸ”„ **Timestamps** - New creation time  
ðŸ”„ **Creator** - Set to current user  
ðŸ”„ **Lock status** - No locks on pasted shapes  

## Keyboard Shortcuts Summary

| Shortcut | Action | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `Cmd/Ctrl + C` | Copy | Copy selected shapes to clipboard |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + V` | Paste | Paste copied shapes (20px offset) |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Z` | Undo | Undo last action (including paste) |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z` | Redo | Redo last undone action |
| `Delete` | Delete | Delete selected shapes |

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **src/components/Canvas/Canvas.jsx**
   - Added `copiedShapes` state to store clipboard
   - Added `Cmd/Ctrl + C` handler to copy selected shapes
   - Added `Cmd/Ctrl + V` handler to paste with batching
   - Pastes use `CreateShapeCommand` for undo/redo support
   - Automatic batching for multiple pastes

2. **src/components/UI/HelpMenu.jsx**
   - Added copy/paste shortcuts to help documentation
   - Added undo/redo shortcuts
   - Added layers panel toggle shortcut

### Code Highlights

**Copy Logic:**
```javascript
// Copy selected shapes (Cmd/Ctrl + C)
if ((e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey) && e.key.toLowerCase() === 'c' && selectedIds.length > 0) {
  const shapesToCopy = selectedIds
    .map(id => shapes.find(s => s.id === id))
    .filter(Boolean);
  
  setCopiedShapes(shapesToCopy);
  showFeedback(`Copied ${shapesToCopy.length} shape(s)`);
}
```

**Paste Logic:**
```javascript
// Paste with offset and batching
const PASTE_OFFSET = 20;

for (const shapeToCopy of copiedShapes) {
  const newShape = {
    ...shapeToCopy,
    id: generateNewId(),
    x: shapeToCopy.x + PASTE_OFFSET,
    y: shapeToCopy.y + PASTE_OFFSET,
    // Reset locks and timestamps
  };
  
  const command = new CreateShapeCommand(/* ... */);
  await execute(command, user);
}
```

## History Integration

### Single Shape Paste
```
History:
- Created rectangle (by You)
```

### Multiple Shapes Paste
```
History:
- Pasted 10 shapes (10 changes) (by You)
```

This batching keeps history clean and allows undoing all pasted shapes at once!

## Workflow Examples

### Duplicate and Arrange
```
1. Create a button shape with text
2. Copy it (Cmd/Ctrl + C)
3. Paste (Cmd/Ctrl + V)
4. Move pasted button to new position
5. Paste (Cmd/Ctrl + V) again
6. Move to another position
7. Repeat - quickly create button array
```

### Create Pattern
```
1. Create 5 shapes in a pattern
2. Select all and copy
3. Paste multiple times
4. Each paste creates full pattern copy
5. Build complex designs quickly
```

### Template Workflow
```
1. Design a complex multi-shape component
2. Copy entire component (all shapes)
3. Paste wherever needed
4. Customize each instance
5. History tracks each paste as one action
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Clipboard is in-app only** - Does not integrate with system clipboard
2. **No cross-tab paste** - Can't copy in one tab and paste in another
3. **Fixed offset** - Always 20px, not configurable
4. **No paste preview** - No preview of where shapes will appear
5. **Relative to copy position** - Offset is from original position, not cursor

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Paste at cursor** - Paste where mouse is hovering
2. **Smart offset** - Detect overlaps and adjust offset
3. **Paste with alignment** - Snap to grid or align to other shapes
4. **Copy with metadata** - Include creation history
5. **Clipboard preview** - Show thumbnail of copied shapes
6. **System clipboard integration** - Copy/paste between apps
7. **Paste multiple times** - Cmd+V, V, V keeps pasting
8. **Paste in place** - Option to paste without offset

## Tips & Tricks

ðŸ’¡ **Quick Duplication:** Select, Cmd+C, Cmd+V, immediately drag to position

ðŸ’¡ **Array Creation:** Copy once, paste multiple times to create arrays

ðŸ’¡ **Preserve Selection:** After paste, shapes are selected - ready to move

ðŸ’¡ **Undo Friendly:** Made a mistake? Cmd+Z removes all pasted shapes

ðŸ’¡ **Batch Operations:** Select 100 shapes, copy, paste - still one undo

ðŸ’¡ **Template Components:** Create reusable components by copy/pasting complex arrangements
