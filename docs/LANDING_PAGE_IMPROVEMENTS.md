}
```

**Result:**

---

### 3. **Delete Confirmation Modal**

**Before:**
- Used browser's `confirm()` dialog
- Ugly, no styling
- Abrupt, no animation

**After:**
- Uses `ConfirmationModal` component
- Beautiful styling matching sign-out modal
- Smooth animations
- Customizable message

**Implementation:**
```jsx
<ConfirmationModal
  isOpen={showDeleteConfirm}
  onConfirm={handleConfirmDelete}
  onCancel={() => {
    setShowDeleteConfirm(false);
    setProjectToDelete(null);
  }}
  title="Delete Project?"
  message={`Are you sure you want to delete "${projectToDelete?.name}"? This action cannot be undone.`}
  confirmText="Delete"
  cancelText="Cancel"
/>
```

**Flow:**
1. Click √ó button on project
2. Confirmation modal slides in
3. Shows project name in message
4. Cancel or Delete with smooth transitions
5. If deleted, card fades out with grid reflow animation

---

### 4. **Favorite Star Animation**

**Added:**
- Star pop animation (0.3s)
- Rotation effect on appearance
- Scale bounce (0 ‚Üí 1.2 ‚Üí 1)
- Smooth integration with project name

**Animation:**
```css
@keyframes starPop {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0) rotate(-180deg);
  }
  50% {
    transform: scale(1.2) rotate(0deg);
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1) rotate(0deg);
  }
}
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Star appears with satisfying pop
- ‚úÖ Spins 180¬∞ as it appears
- ‚úÖ Bounces to final size
- ‚úÖ Name slides smoothly (via flex gap)

---

### 5. **Redo Fixed for Design Suggestions**

**Problem:**
- Undo worked ‚úÖ
- Redo failed ‚ùå
- Error: `command.redo is not a function`

**Root Cause:**
The undo manager calls `command.redo()` but `SuggestionCommand` only had `execute()` and `undo()`.

**Fix:**
Added `redo()` method to `SuggestionCommand`:

```javascript
async redo() {
  // Reapply after state (same as execute for this command)
  for (const shape of this.afterState) {
    const shapeRef = ref(rtdb, `canvas/${this.canvasId}/shapes/${shape.id}`);
    await set(shapeRef, shape);
  }
  return this.description;
}
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Redo now works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Cmd+Shift+Z reapplies changes
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging for debugging
