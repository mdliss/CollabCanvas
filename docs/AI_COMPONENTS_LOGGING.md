# 🤖 AI Components - Comprehensive Logging

**Date**: 2025-10-18  
**Purpose**: Debug AI Assistant history registration and panel positioning issues  
**Status**: ✅ Logging Active

---

## 🎯 Issues Being Debugged

### Issue 1: AI Assistant Insertions Not Linked to History
**Problem:** AI assistant creates shapes but they don't appear in history timeline  
**What to check:** Registration flow from Cloud Function → RTDB → AIOperationCommand → Undo Manager

### Issue 2: Design Suggestions Panel Positioning Inconsistent
**Problem:** Panel doesn't consistently go to the correct location  
**What to check:** Position calculation based on isOpen and isAIOpen states

### Issue 3: Panel Moves When AI Assistant Closed
**Problem:** Sometimes moves to location when AI assistant is open when it's actually closed  
**What to check:** Event emission/listening and state synchronization

### 3. **Design Suggestions Positioning** (`AIDesignSuggestions.jsx`)

Comprehensive positioning logging with state tracking:

#### Event Listening
```
[🎯 DESIGN] 📡 Listening for aiAssistantToggle events
```

#### Event Received
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[🎯 DESIGN SUGGESTIONS] Received aiAssistantToggle event
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[🎯 DESIGN] Event received at: 2025-10-18T12:34:56.789Z
[🎯 DESIGN] Event detail: { isOpen: true }
[🎯 DESIGN] AI Assistant state: OPEN
[🎯 DESIGN] Design Suggestions state: OPEN
[🎯 DESIGN] Previous isAIOpen: CLOSED
[🎯 DESIGN] New isAIOpen: OPEN
[🎯 DESIGN] Setting isAIOpen state to: true
[🎯 DESIGN] ✅ State updated - will recalculate position
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

#### Event Emission

[🎯 DESIGN]   - Only Design open: right = 20px (far right)
[🎯 DESIGN]   - Both open: right = 410px (slides left for AI)
[🎯 DESIGN]   - Only AI open: Design closed (no position)
[🎯 DESIGN] Actual position: right = 410px
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## 🧪 How to Use the Logging

### Test Scenario 1: AI History Registration

**Steps:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Open AI Assistant (✨ button)
3. Type: "create 5 blue rectangles"
4. Send message
5. Watch console logs

**What to look for:**

✅ **Success Pattern:**
```
[📝 AI HISTORY] ✓ All preconditions met
[📝 AI HISTORY] Processing 1 tool calls
[📝 AI HISTORY] Total affected shapes: 5
[📝 AI HISTORY] Shape data retrieved: 5 shapes
[📝 AI HISTORY] ✅ REGISTRATION COMPLETE
```

❌ **Failure Patterns:**

**No Operation ID:**
```
[📝 AI HISTORY] ⚠️ Registration skipped
[📝 AI HISTORY]   - operationId: undefined (expected truthy)
```
→ **Root cause:** Cloud Function didn't return operation ID

**registerAIOperation Missing:**
```
[📝 AI HISTORY] ⚠️ Registration skipped
[📝 AI HISTORY]   - registerAIOperation: false (expected true)
```
→ **Root cause:** UndoContext not providing the function

**Shapes Not Found:**
```
[📝 AI HISTORY] ⚠️ Warning: 3 shapes not found in canvas!
[📝 AI HISTORY] Shape data retrieved: 2 shapes
```
→ **Root cause:** Timing issue - shapes not yet written to RTDB

### Test Scenario 2: Panel Positioning

**Steps:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Click Design Suggestions button (💡)
3. Watch positioning logs
4. Click AI Assistant button (✨)
5. Watch both panels adjust

**What to look for:**

#### Only Design Open:
```
[🎯 DESIGN] Current state: { isOpen: true, isAIOpen: false }
[🎯 DESIGN] Actual position: right = 20px
```
✅ **Expected:** Design at far right (20px)

#### Both Open:
```
[🎯 DESIGN] Current state: { isOpen: true, isAIOpen: true }
[🎯 DESIGN] Actual position: right = 410px
```
✅ **Expected:** Design slides left (410px), AI stays right (20px)

#### Close AI Assistant:
```
[🎯 AI ASSISTANT] New state: CLOSED
[🎯 AI ASSISTANT] 📡 Emitting aiAssistantToggle event: CLOSED

[🎯 DESIGN] Received aiAssistantToggle event
[🎯 DESIGN] New isAIOpen: CLOSED
[🎯 DESIGN] Actual position: right = 20px
```
✅ **Expected:** Design slides back to right (20px)

---

### Test Scenario 3: Debugging State Desync

**Symptom:** Panel moves when AI is actually closed

**Debug steps:**
1. Watch for event emissions:
   ```
   [🎯 AI ASSISTANT] 📡 Emitting aiAssistantToggle event: CLOSED
   ```

2. Check if Design received it:
   ```
   [🎯 DESIGN] Received aiAssistantToggle event
   [🎯 DESIGN] New isAIOpen: CLOSED
   ```

3. Check position calculation:
   ```
   [🎯 DESIGN] isOpen: true, isAIOpen: false
   [🎯 DESIGN] Actual position: right = 20px
   ```

**Possible issues:**

❌ **Event not received:**
```
[🎯 AI ASSISTANT] ✅ Event dispatched
... no corresponding [🎯 DESIGN] Received event ...
```
→ **Root cause:** Event listener not registered

❌ **Wrong state in calculation:**
```
[🎯 DESIGN] isAIOpen: true (but AI is actually closed)
```
→ **Root cause:** State not updated from event

❌ **Stale closure:**
```
[🎯 DESIGN] Event detail: { isOpen: false }
[🎯 DESIGN] Setting isAIOpen state to: false
... but position calculation still uses isAIOpen: true ...
```
→ **Root cause:** useEffect dependencies issue

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Registration skipped - operationId undefined"

**Diagnosis:**
```
[📝 AI HISTORY] Operation ID: undefined
[📝 AI HISTORY] ⚠️ Registration skipped
```

**Possible causes:**
1. Cloud Function not returning operationId
2. Network error during AI request
3. Response parsing error

**Check:**
- Network tab for Cloud Function response
- Console for API errors before registration

---

### Issue: "Shapes not found in canvas"

**Diagnosis:**
```
[📝 AI HISTORY] Total affected shapes: 10
[📝 AI HISTORY] Shape data retrieved: 7 shapes
[📝 AI HISTORY] ⚠️ Warning: 3 shapes not found in canvas!
```

**Possible causes:**
1. RTDB write latency - shapes not yet synced
2. Shapes were deleted before registration
3. Shape IDs mismatch

**Solution:**
- Add delay before fetching shape data
- Retry fetch if shapes missing

---

### Issue: "Panel in wrong position"

**Diagnosis:**
```
[🎯 DESIGN] isOpen: true, isAIOpen: false
[🎯 DESIGN] Actual position: right = 410px  ← WRONG!
```

**Possible causes:**
1. Stale state in calculation
2. Event not received
3. React render timing issue

**Solution:**
- Check event flow in logs
- Verify useEffect dependencies
- Look for stale closures

---

### Issue: "registerAIOperation is false"

**Diagnosis:**
```
[📝 AI HISTORY] registerAIOperation function exists: false
[📝 AI HISTORY] ⚠️ Registration skipped
```

**Possible causes:**
1. UndoContext not wrapping component
2. useUndo() hook not called
3. Context value not provided

**Solution:**
- Check component tree for UndoProvider
- Verify useUndo() is called
- Check if other undo features work

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

Based on the logs, you can now:

1. **Identify registration failures** - See exactly where and why AI operations aren't being registered
2. **Track positioning issues** - See state changes and position calculations in real-time
3. **Debug event flow** - Verify events are emitted and received correctly
4. **Measure performance** - See timing for all operations

**All logs use clear emojis and formatting for easy scanning:**
- 📝 = History registration
- 🎯 = Positioning
- ✅ = Success
- ⚠️ = Warning
- ❌ = Error
- 📡 = Event emission/listening
