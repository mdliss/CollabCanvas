---

## 🐛 Common Issues & How to Debug

### Issue 1: "Apply Fix doesn't change canvas"

**Symptoms:**
- Click "Apply Fix" button
- Button shows "Applied" but shapes don't change
- No visual update

**Debug steps:**

1. **Check Backend Logs:**
   Look for: `✅ Shape shape_123 updated successfully`
   - If missing → Backend didn't apply changes
   - If present → Backend applied, frontend issue

2. **Check Before/After Comparison:**
   Look for: `fontSize: 12 → 16 ✅ CHANGED`
   - If shows `⚠️  NO CHANGE!` → Same value, not actually changing
   - If shows `✅ CHANGED` → Update worked

3. **Check RTDB Path:**
   Look for: `Path: ai-operations/...`
   - Verify operation data was stored
   - Check path is correct for your user

4. **Verify Shape IDs Match:**
   - Analysis returns shape IDs
   - Apply uses those same IDs
   - Check they match shapes on canvas

---

### Issue 2: "Undo button doesn't appear"

**Symptoms:**
- Apply a suggestion
- No ↶ Undo button shows up

**Debug steps:**

1. **Check Command Storage:**
   Look for: `💾 Last applied command updated`
   - If missing → Command not stored
   - Check `registerAIOperation` was called

2. **Check lastAppliedCommand State:**
   Look for: `Last applied command stored: true`
   - If false → Command wasn't saved to state
   - Check React state update

3. **Check Conditional Rendering:**
   Button only shows if `lastAppliedCommand` exists
   - Verify state is truthy

---

### Issue 3: "Undo doesn't work / doesn't revert changes"

**Symptoms:**
- Click Undo button or press Cmd+Z
- Shapes don't revert to original state

**Debug steps:**

1. **Check Undo Method:**
   Look for: `undoFromContext available: true`
   - If false → Context method missing!
   - Check UndoContext is properly imported

2. **Check Command Execution:**
   Look for: `⏮️  [SuggestionCommand] UNDO - Reverting changes`
   - If missing → Undo command never called
   - If present → Command was called

3. **Check Shape Reversion:**
   Look for: `✅ Shape shape_123 reverted`
   - If missing → RTDB write failed
   - If present → Check original values match

4. **Check Before State:**
   Look for: `Reverting shape_123 to original: { fontSize: 12 }`
   - Verify original values are correct
   - Check they differ from current values

---

### Issue 4: "No suggestions appear / empty suggestions"

**Symptoms:**
- Click Analyze
- Shows "Your design looks great" even with obvious issues

**Debug steps:**

1. **Check Shape Count:**
   Look for: `Shapes fetched: 0`
   - If 0 → Canvas is empty
   - If > 0 → Check AI response

2. **Check AI Response:**
   Look for: `Raw AI response: { "suggestions": [] }`
   - If empty array → AI thinks design is good
   - Check the canvas data sent to AI

3. **Check Canvas Data:**
   Look for: `Sample shapes: [ ... ]`
   - Verify shapes have proper data (fontSize, fill, etc.)
   - Check values are what you expect

4. **AI Being Too Conservative:**
   - Small canvas (<5 shapes) → AI is very lenient
   - Check if issues are actually severe enough

---

### Issue 5: "History Timeline doesn't show applied suggestions"

**Symptoms:**
- Apply suggestion
- Open History Timeline (📜)
- No entry appears

**Debug steps:**

1. **Check Registration:**
   Look for: `✅ [UNDO REGISTRATION] COMPLETE`
   - If missing → Registration failed
   - If present → Command was registered

2. **Check registerAIOperation:**
   Look for: `registerAIOperation available: true`
   - If false → Method not available!
   - Check UndoContext export

3. **Check isAI Flag:**
   Look for: `isAI: true`
   - Must be true for purple styling
   - Check SuggestionCommand constructor

4. **Check getHistoryEntry:**
   Look for: `[SuggestionCommand] getHistoryEntry called`
   - Should be called when timeline renders
   - Check return value has all fields

---

### Issue 6: "Panels overlap"

**Symptoms:**
- Open Design Suggestions
- Open AI Assistant
- Panels overlap/collide

**Debug steps:**

1. **Check Button Positions:**
   - Design Suggestions: `right: 136px, bottom: 20px`
   - AI Assistant: `right: 78px, bottom: 20px`
   - Should be 58px apart (136 - 78)

2. **Check Panel Positions:**
   - Both should have `bottom: 78px`
   - Different `right` values (136px vs 78px)

3. **Check Dynamic Right Calculation:**
   ```javascript
   baseRight = 78 + 48 + 10 = 136px
   ```
   - Verify calculation is correct

---

## 📝 State Tracking Logs

The component tracks all state changes:

```
[AIDesignSuggestions] 📊 Suggestions state updated:
  Count: 3
  Suggestions: [ ... ]

[AIDesignSuggestions] ✓ Applied suggestions updated:
  Count: 1
  IDs: ["suggestion_001"]

[AIDesignSuggestions] 💾 Last applied command updated:
  Description: Design Fix: Increase font size to 16px
  Shapes affected: 2

[AIDesignSuggestions] 🗑️  Last applied command cleared
```

**When these appear:**
- Suggestions updated → After analysis completes
- Applied suggestions → After clicking "Apply Fix"
- Last command updated → After undo registration
- Last command cleared → After clicking Undo button

---

## 🧪 Debugging Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Component Loaded
```javascript
// Look for mount log
🚀 [AIDesignSuggestions] Component MOUNTED
```

✅ **Check:**
- registerAIOperation available: true
- undoFromContext available: true
- User is logged in

---

### Step 2: Trigger Analysis
```javascript
// Open panel, click Analyze
🔍 [DESIGN ANALYSIS] STARTING
```

✅ **Check:**
- Shapes fetched > 0
- OpenAI call succeeds
- JSON parses
- Suggestions returned

---

### Step 3: Apply Suggestion
```javascript
// Click "Apply Fix"
🔧 [APPLY SUGGESTION] STARTING
```

✅ **Check:**
- Before state captured
- Cloud Function returns success
- After state captured
- Changes detected in comparison
- Undo registration complete

---

### Step 4: Verify Undo Works
```javascript
// Click Undo or press Cmd+Z
⏮️  [SuggestionCommand] UNDO
```

✅ **Check:**
- Shapes revert to before state
- Original values restored
- Canvas updates visually

---

## 🚨 Error Patterns

### Pattern 1: "registerAIOperation is not available!"
```
❌ [UNDO REGISTRATION] FAILED
registerAIOperation is not available!
```

**Fix:** Check UndoContext integration
- Verify import: `import { useUndo } from '../../contexts/UndoContext'`
- Verify destructure: `const { registerAIOperation } = useUndo()`

---

### Pattern 2: "Shape not found after update"
```
⚠️  Shape shape_123 not found after update!
```

**Fix:** Shape was deleted between apply and state capture
- Check if shape still exists on canvas
- Timing issue - shape deleted by another user

---

### Pattern 3: "NO CHANGES DETECTED"
```
❌ NO CHANGES DETECTED FOR THIS SHAPE!
fontSize: 12 → 12 ⚠️  NO CHANGE!
```

**Fix:** Same value being applied
- Check if suggestion has correct values
- AI might have suggested same fontSize as current
- Backend update might have failed silently

---

### Pattern 4: "Failed to parse AI response"
```
❌ Failed to parse AI response
  Parse error: Unexpected token...
```

**Fix:** OpenAI returned invalid JSON
- Check raw response in logs
- Might have markdown formatting
- Retry analysis

---

## 🎯 Quick Debug Commands

### Check Undo Manager State
```javascript
window.undoManager.getFullHistory()
```

**Look for:** Entries with `isAI: true` and description starting with "Design Fix:"

---

### Check Last Applied Command
```javascript
// In console after applying suggestion
// (The component stores it in state, not window)
```

---

### Check RTDB Operation Data
```javascript
// After applying suggestion, check RTDB directly
firebase.database()
  .ref('ai-operations/<your-uid>/operations')
  .once('value')
  .then(s => console.log(s.val()))
```

**Look for:** Operations with `type: 'suggestion_applied'`

---

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | Expected Time | If Slower, Check |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| Analysis | 2-5 seconds | OpenAI timeout, too many shapes |
| Apply | 300-500ms | RTDB slow, network issues |
| Undo | 200-400ms | Too many shapes to revert |
| State capture | 100-200ms | Large canvas, slow RTDB read |

---
