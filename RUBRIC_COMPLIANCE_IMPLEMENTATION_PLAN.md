## Section 1: Core Collaborative Infrastructure (Current: 24-26/30, Target: 30/30)

### 1.1 Real-Time Synchronization (Current: 10-11/12, Target: 11-12)

#### **Current State Analysis:**

**What's Working:**
- Drag position streaming at 100Hz (every 10ms via `dragStream.js`)
- Cursor updates throttled to 30Hz (every 33ms) with intelligent 2px delta filtering
- Performance monitoring system actively tracking sync latency, cursor frequency, and FPS
- RTDB subscriptions via `onValue` for instant updates across all clients
- Checkpoint system writes position every 500ms during drag operations

**Measured Performance (from code analysis):**
- Drag stream broadcast frequency: 10ms (100Hz) ✅
- Cursor update throttle: 33ms (30Hz) ✅
- 2px movement filter reduces unnecessary cursor updates
- Delta compression for drag positions (only sends changed values)
- Performance metrics tracked in circular buffer (last 100 samples)

**Performance Monitoring Infrastructure:**
```javascript
// From performance.js:
- syncLatency: p50, p95, p99 tracked
- cursorFrequency: avg and Hz calculated
- fps: avg, min, max during editing
- Metrics sent to Firebase Analytics every 60 seconds
```

**Gap Analysis:**
- **Missing:** Explicit measurement/verification that object sync < 100ms
- **Missing:** Explicit measurement/verification that cursor sync < 50ms  
- **Assumed working:** Code suggests performance should meet criteria, but needs verification
- **Potential issue:** No performance degradation monitoring under load

---

#### **TASK 1.1.1: Add Real-Time Latency Measurement and Verification**

**Rationale:** Need to explicitly measure and verify that sync latencies meet rubric criteria (sub-100ms objects, sub-50ms cursors)

**Complexity:** Low  
**Risk:** Low (purely additive, no breaking changes)

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Enhance `performance.js` to add explicit latency measurement
2. Add timestamping to drag position broadcasts
3. Calculate and track latency when receiving remote drag updates
4. Add cursor latency measurement (time from local movement to seeing on remote)
5. Add performance thresholds and warnings if exceeded
6. Display real-time latency in PerformanceMonitor UI component
7. Log p50/p95/p99 latencies to console and Firebase Analytics

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/services/performance.js` - Add latency measurement methods
- `src/services/dragStream.js` - Add send timestamp to broadcasts
- `src/hooks/useDragStreams.js` - Measure receive latency
- `src/services/cursors.js` - Add cursor latency tracking
- `src/components/UI/PerformanceMonitor.jsx` - Display latency metrics

**Dependencies:** None

**Verification:**
- Open two browser windows
- Drag objects and move cursors
- Check PerformanceMonitor shows object sync < 100ms
- Check cursor sync < 50ms
- Verify metrics logged to console

---

#### **TASK 1.1.2: Add Performance Degradation Detection**

**Rationale:** System should detect and report when performance degrades below acceptable levels

**Complexity:** Low  
**Risk:** Low

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add threshold constants for acceptable latencies
2. Add alerting when thresholds exceeded
3. Track degradation frequency over time
4. Add visual warning in UI when performance degrades
5. Log performance issues to analytics for monitoring

**Files to Modify:**

---

### 1.2 Conflict Resolution & State Management (Current: 7-8/9, Target: 8-9)

#### **Current State Analysis:**

**What's Working:**
- Lock-based conflict resolution with 8-second TTL
- Lock acquisition via `tryLockShape()` before edit operations
- Stale lock detection and stealing after TTL expires
- Visual feedback: Red stroke for locked shapes, blue for selected
- Selection badges showing who has what shape
- Lock state stored in RTDB: `isLocked`, `lockedBy`, `lockedAt`
- Unlock on drag/transform end

**Lock Flow:**
```
1. User initiates drag/transform
2. tryLockShape() checks if shape locked by another user
3. If locked and TTL not expired → deny
4. If locked and TTL expired → steal lock
5. If unlocked → acquire lock
6. Perform operation
7. Unlock on completion
```

**Conflict Scenarios Handled:**
✅ Simultaneous drag attempts - lock prevents conflicts  
✅ Rapid edits - lock protects during entire operation  
✅ Delete vs edit - lock would prevent (need to verify)  
✅ Create collisions - RTDB atomic operations prevent dupes  

**Gap Analysis:**
- **Major gap:** No documented conflict resolution strategy
- **Missing:** Explicit documentation of lock behavior
- **Missing:** Verification that 10+ edits/second works correctly
- **Unclear:** What happens when lock expires during active edit?
- **Unclear:** Last-write-wins behavior for non-locked scenarios
- **Missing:** Ghost object prevention verification
- **Good:** Visual feedback exists but could be clearer

---

#### **TASK 1.2.1: Document Conflict Resolution Strategy**

**Rationale:** Rubric requires "documented conflict resolution strategy"

**Complexity:** Low  
**Risk:** None (documentation only)

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create comprehensive documentation file: `CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_STRATEGY.md`
2. Document lock-based approach with TTL
3. Document last-write-wins for non-locked shapes
4. Document atomic RTDB operations preventing race conditions
5. Document stale lock stealing behavior
6. Document visual feedback system
7. Add inline code comments in `canvasRTDB.js` explaining strategy
8. Add comments in lock acquisition/release functions

**Content to Document:**
- Lock-based editing with 8-second TTL
- How locks prevent simultaneous edits
- Last-write-wins for unlocked shapes (RTDB atomic updates)
- Stale lock stealing after TTL
- RTDB atomic operations preventing create collisions
- Visual feedback: red = locked, blue = selected, orange = being dragged by other
- Checkpoint system for in-progress operations
- Undo/redo handling of conflicts

**Files to Create:**
- `CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_STRATEGY.md` (new documentation file)

**Files to Modify:**

2. Add timestamp showing when shape was last edited
3. Add visual indicator showing edit in progress vs locked vs idle
4. Add tooltip showing lock owner and time remaining
5. Consider adding edit history hover (optional)

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/components/Collaboration/SelectionBadge.jsx` - Add last editor info
- `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.jsx` - Pass last editor data to badge

**Dependencies:** None

**Verification:**

---

#### **TASK 1.2.4: Implement Lock Expiration Handling During Active Edit**

**Rationale:** Currently unclear what happens if lock expires while user is actively editing

**Complexity:** Medium  
**Risk:** Medium (changes core locking behavior)

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add lock renewal mechanism during long operations
2. Every 4 seconds during drag/transform, refresh lock timestamp
3. Add warning to user if lock about to expire

### 1.3 Persistence & Reconnection (Current: 7-8/9, Target: 8-9)

#### **Current State Analysis:**

**What's Working:**
✅ Checkpoint system writes position every 500ms during drag (JUST IMPLEMENTED!)  
✅ RTDB persists all canvas data automatically  
✅ Connection status UI shows online/offline/reconnecting  
✅ Firebase auto-reconnects on network restoration  
✅ Offline queue implemented using IndexedDB  
✅ Disconnect handlers for presence and cursor data  

**Persistence Mechanisms:**
- **Shapes:** Stored in RTDB at `canvas/{canvasId}/shapes/{shapeId}`
- **Checkpoints:** Written every 500ms during active drag/transform operations
- **Offline queue:** IndexedDB-based queue in `offline.js`
- **Metadata:** Last updated timestamp tracked

**Reconnection Flow:**
```
1. Connection drops → ConnectionStatus shows "Offline"
2. Firebase onDisconnect handlers fire
3. Presence/cursor data cleaned up
4. Offline queue stores pending operations (if integrated)
5. Network restored → Firebase auto-reconnects
6. ConnectionStatus shows "Reconnecting..."
7. RTDB resyncs all data
8. Offline queue operations replayed (if integrated)
9. ConnectionStatus shows "Connected"
```

**Gap Analysis:**
- **Checkpoint system:** Excellent! Just implemented ✅
- **Issue:** Offline queue exists but may not be fully integrated with all operations
- **Missing:** Verification that offline queue actually works end-to-end
- **Missing:** Clear documentation of data loss scenarios
- **Missing:** Testing of 30+ second disconnect scenarios

- Authenticated users can write canvas (with validation)
- Users can read any profile
- Users can only update their own profile
- Bio field limited to 200 characters
- Default deny for everything else

**RTDB Security Rules (database.rules.json):**
```json
{
  "sessions": { ".read": "auth != null", ".write": "auth != null" },
  "selections": { ".read": "auth != null", ".write": "auth != null" },
  "drags": { ".read": "auth != null", "global-canvas-v1": { "$shapeId": { ".write": "auth != null" } } }
}
```

**Critical Security Gap:**
🔴 **Missing canvas rules in RTDB!** The `canvas/` path is not defined in database.rules.json
🔴 **Overly permissive:** All auth'd users can write anything to sessions/selections/drags
🔴 **No validation:** RTDB rules don't validate data structure or user permissions

**Gap Analysis:**
- **Major security issue:** Canvas data path not secured in RTDB rules
- **Issue:** No validation of shape data in RTDB rules
- **Issue:** No user-specific permissions (any auth'd user can edit anything)
- **Risk:** Malicious user could corrupt canvas data
- **Risk:** User could delete all shapes, modify others' work without locks

---

#### **TASK 5.2.1: FIX CRITICAL - Add RTDB Security Rules for Canvas Data**

**Rationale:** Canvas data is completely unsecured! This is a critical security vulnerability

**Complexity:** Medium  
**Risk:** High (security critical)  
**Priority:** HIGHEST

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add `canvas/` path to database.rules.json
2. Require authentication for all canvas operations
3. Add validation rules for shape structure
4. Add lock validation (only lock owner can edit locked shapes)
5. Limit shape properties to prevent injection
6. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
7. Test all rules thoroughly

**Proposed Rules:**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "canvas": {
      "$canvasId": {
        ".read": "auth != null",
        "shapes": {
          "$shapeId": {
            ".write": "auth != null && (
              // Allow if shape doesn't exist (create)
              !data.exists() ||
              // Allow if shape is not locked
              !data.child('isLocked').val() ||
              // Allow if user owns the lock
              data.child('lockedBy').val() == auth.uid ||
              // Allow if lock is stale (> 10 seconds old)
              now - data.child('lockedAt').val() > 10000
            )",
            ".validate": "newData.hasChildren(['id', 'type', 'x', 'y', 'createdBy', 'createdAt'])"
          }
        },
        "metadata": {
          ".write": "auth != null"
        }
      }
    },
    "sessions": {
      "$sessionId": {
        ".read": "auth != null",
        ".write": "auth != null && $sessionId == auth.uid"
      }
    },
    "selections": {
      "$sessionId": {
        ".read": "auth != null",
        ".write": "auth != null && $sessionId == auth.uid"
      }
    },
    "drags": {
      ".read": "auth != null",
      "global-canvas-v1": {
        "$shapeId": {
          ".write": "auth != null"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Files to Modify:**
- `database.rules.json` - Add comprehensive RTDB rules

**Dependencies:** None

**Verification:**
- Deploy new rules to Firebase
- Test creating shapes (should work)
- Test editing locked shape by non-owner (should fail)
- Test editing unlocked shape (should work)
- Test with unauthenticated user (should fail)
- Test malformed data (should fail validation)

---

#### **TASK 5.2.2: Add Input Validation and Sanitization**

**Rationale:** Prevent XSS and injection attacks

**Complexity:** Medium  
**Risk:** Low

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add validation to all user inputs
2. Sanitize text shape content
3. Validate color hex codes
4. Validate numerical ranges (position, size)
5. Add validation to createShape/updateShape functions
6. Prevent HTML injection in text shapes

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/services/canvasRTDB.js` - Add validation functions
- `src/components/Canvas/ShapeRenderer.jsx` - Sanitize text rendering

**Dependencies:** None

**Verification:**
- Attempt to create shape with invalid data
- Verify validation prevents it
- Try XSS payload in text shape
- Verify properly sanitized

---

#### **TASK 5.2.3: Audit for Exposed Credentials**

**Rationale:** Ensure no API keys or secrets exposed in client code

**Complexity:** Low  
**Risk:** None (audit only)

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Search codebase for hardcoded keys
2. Verify Firebase config uses environment variables
3. Check for any exposed secrets
4. Verify .gitignore includes sensitive files
5. Review Firebase console for any exposed keys
6. Document proper credential management

**Files to Check:**
- `src/services/firebase.js` - Verify config source
- `.env` files - Ensure not committed
- `.gitignore` - Verify includes .env

**Dependencies:** None

**Verification:**
- No hardcoded credentials found
- Firebase config properly sourced
- Environment variables used correctly

---

#### **TASK 5.2.4: Implement Rate Limiting**

**Rationale:** Prevent abuse of real-time features

**Complexity:** Medium  
**Risk:** Low

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add rate limiting to drag broadcasts (already done - 100Hz max)
2. Add rate limiting to cursor updates (already done - 30Hz max)
3. Add rate limiting to shape creation (prevent spam)
4. Add rate limiting to RTDB writes
5. Add user feedback when rate limited
6. Log rate limit violations

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/services/canvasRTDB.js` - Add rate limiting to create/update operations

**Dependencies:** None

**Verification:**
- Rapidly create shapes
- Verify rate limiting kicks in
- Verify user feedback displayed
