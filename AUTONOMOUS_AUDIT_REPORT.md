$ git fetch --all
# Fetched latest

$ git switch -c feature/realtime-sync
Switched to a new branch 'feature/realtime-sync'
```

$ npm run lint
‚úÖ No linter errors found
```

## üîé Gap Detection Results

### Audit Methodology:
1. Grepped for `isLocked`, `lockedBy`, `lockedAt` in Firestore write paths ‚úÖ
2. Confirmed transaction/guard blocks non-owners on move/delete ‚ö†Ô∏è
3. Confirmed UI badges show to ALL users (not just local selection) ‚úÖ
4. Confirmed sweeper clears stale locks ‚â§5s + runs on visibilitychange ‚úÖ
5. Confirmed onDisconnect cleanup for presence/cursors ‚úÖ

### üö® GAP FOUND: deleteShape Missing Lock Guard

**Location:** `src/services/canvas.js:162-194`

**Problem:**
```javascript
export const deleteShape = async (canvasId, shapeId) => {
  // ... transaction ...
  const filteredShapes = shapes.filter(shape => shape.id !== shapeId);
  // ‚ùå No lock check! Allows delete of locked shapes
}
```

**Impact:** Violated PRD ¬ß4-¬ß5 requirement  
**Severity:** HIGH (breaks multiplayer locking)

### ‚úÖ GAP FIXED

**Solution Applied:**
```javascript
export const deleteShape = async (canvasId, shapeId, user) => {
  // ... transaction ...
  const shapeToDelete = shapes.find(s => s.id === shapeId);
  if (shapeToDelete && shapeToDelete.isLocked && shapeToDelete.lockedBy !== user?.uid) {
    console.warn("[deleteShape] Cannot delete - shape locked by another user");
    throw new Error(`Shape is locked by another user`);
  }
  const filteredShapes = shapes.filter(shape => shape.id !== shapeId);
  // ‚úÖ Lock respected
}
```

**Canvas.jsx Integration:**
```javascript
const handleKeyDown = async (e) => {
  if ((e.key === "Delete" || e.key === "Backspace") && selectedId) {
    try {
      await deleteShape(CANVAS_ID, selectedId, user); // Pass user
      setSelectedId(null);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("[Canvas] Delete failed:", error.message);
      setLastError(error.message); // Show in DebugNote overlay
    }
  }
};
```

**Evidence:** Commit 773516a

## ‚úÖ Implementation Verification (Static Analysis)

### Lock Acquisition
- **Function:** `tryLockShape(canvasId, shapeId, userId, ttlMs=4000)`
- **Location:** `canvas.js:197-244`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ VERIFIED
- **Evidence:** First-touch locking with 4s TTL; checks existing locks and expiration

### Lock Release
- **Function:** `unlockShape(canvasId, shapeId, userId)`
- **Location:** `canvas.js:255-293`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ VERIFIED
- **Evidence:** Only lock owner can release; sets isLocked:false

### Stale Lock Sweeper
- **Function:** `staleLockSweeper(canvasId, ttlMs=5000)`
- **Location:** `canvas.js:300-337`
- **Wiring:** `Canvas.jsx:194-211`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ VERIFIED
- **Evidence:** 
  - Runs every 2 seconds via `setInterval`
  - Runs on `visibilitychange` event
  - Clears locks older than 5s
  - Logs cleanup count

### Lock Guards on Operations
- **updateShape:** ‚úÖ Blocks non-owners (canvas.js:129-131)
- **deleteShape:** ‚úÖ Blocks non-owners (canvas.js:178-181) **‚Üê NEW FIX**

### Lock Badges (Visual Feedback)
- **Location:** `Canvas.jsx:265-292`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ VERIFIED
- **Evidence:**
  - Checks `isLockedByOther` for all shapes (not just selected)
  - Shows `üîí {displayName}` above locked shapes
  - Looks up lock owner from `onlineUsers`
  - Uses lock owner's color

### Shape Drag Lock Integration
- **Location:** `Canvas.jsx:150-153, 256-260`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ VERIFIED
- **Evidence:**
  - `handleRequestLock` calls `tryLockShape`
  - Passed to Shape as `onRequestLock` prop
  - Shape.jsx cancels drag if lock fails

### Cleanup Paths
- **Presence:** ‚úÖ `setUserOffline(uid)` on unmount (usePresence.js:31)
- **Cursors:** ‚úÖ `clearCursor(uid)` on unmount (useCursors.js:59)
- **RTDB:** ‚úÖ `onDisconnect().update({ online:false, cursorX:null, cursorY:null })` (presence.js:37-40)
