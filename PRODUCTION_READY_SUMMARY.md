## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy Everything (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Initialize Firebase Storage (if not done)
# Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/collabcanvas-99a09/storage
# Click "Get Started" → "Production mode" → Select location

# 2. Deploy all rules
firebase deploy --only firestore,storage

# 3. Build and deploy app
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

### Option 2: Deploy Rules Only (Faster)

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore,storage
```

---

## 🧪 Test Before Full Deployment

Quick 2-minute test to verify profile upload works:

```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Test upload:
# - Sign in
# - Click avatar at top-center → dropdown opens
# - Click large avatar in dropdown
# - Select image < 5MB
# - Watch "Uploading..." state
# - Verify avatar updates in 1-3 seconds

# 3. Check console for logs:
# [AuthBar] Profile picture updated: https://firebasestorage...
# [profilePicture] Upload complete...
```

## 🐛 Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

### Performance (Recommended to Test)
- ⚠️ Not validated with 500+ shapes
- ⚠️ Not validated with 5+ concurrent users
- ⚠️ Profile popup performance with 10+ users not tested

### Optimizations (Future Enhancements)
- ⚠️ No image compression before upload (stores full-resolution)
- ⚠️ No image cropping tool (user must crop externally)
- ⚠️ No profile cache TTL (profiles cached indefinitely in session)
- ⚠️ No loading spinner during initial shape load

**None of these block production deployment.**

## 📈 Next Steps After Deployment

### Week 1: Monitor
- Storage usage (5GB free tier limit)
- Firestore read/write counts
- RTDB concurrent connections
- Profile picture load times

### Week 2: Optimize
- Add client-side image compression
- Resize images to 256×256px optimal size
- Implement profile cache TTL (5 min)
- Add loading spinners

### Week 3: Enhance
- Image cropping tool
- Bundle size optimization
- Lazy loading for large canvas areas
- Offline persistence for Firestore
