# UI Improvements & Critical Fixes - Complete

## ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

### 1. ✅ Activity Timeline Fabricated Data (FIXED)

**Problem**:
Leaderboard showing activity from Oct 12-13, but accounts created on Oct 14. Data was being fabricated/simulated.

**User Report**:
> "The logic of the leaderboard might be a bit flawed since I made both of the accounts on October 14th and there seem to be changes being made on October 12th and October 13th"

**Root Cause**:
`generateActivityData()` in LeaderboardModal was simulating random activity data for the past 7 days, regardless of when accounts were created.

**Solution**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN - Fabricated data):
users.forEach(user => {
  const avgDaily = user.changesCount / 7;
  const variance = Math.random() * 0.8 + 0.6;
  const changes = Math.round(Math.max(0, avgDaily * variance));
  dayData[user.uid] = changes; // Random fake data!
});

// AFTER (FIXED - No fabrication):
users.forEach(user => {
  dayData[user.uid] = 0; // All zeros until we track real daily activity
});
// TODO: Track actual daily activity in Firestore for real data
```

**Result**: Timeline now shows all zeros (accurate) instead of fake data

**Future Enhancement**: Track daily activity changes in Firestore to show real historical data
