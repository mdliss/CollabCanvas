# Layers Panel & Toolbar Revamp

## Overview
Complete redesign of the Layers Panel and Shape Toolbar with improved aesthetics, better functionality, and bug fixes.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Keyboard Shortcuts Bug** ⌨️
**Problem:** `Shift+[` and `Shift+]` keyboard shortcuts weren't working at all.

**Root Cause:** The keyboard event handler in the `useEffect` was defined before the `handleBringForward` and `handleSendBackward` functions were created. This meant the event handler had undefined references to these functions.

**Solution:** Inlined the z-index operations directly in the keyboard handler instead of calling external functions.

**Code Before:**
```javascript
if (e.key === '[') {
  e.preventDefault();
  await handleSendBackward(); // undefined!
  return;
}
```

**Code After:**
```javascript
if (e.key === '[') {
  e.preventDefault();
  for (const id of selectedIds) {
    await sendBackward(CANVAS_ID, id, user);
  }
  showFeedback(message);
  return;
}
```

**Files Modified:** `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.jsx`

## New Features

### 2. **Revamped Layers Panel** 📋

#### Removed Features:
- ❌ Lock/Unlock functionality (removed entirely)
- ❌ Show/Hide visibility toggle (removed entirely)
- ❌ Emoji buttons that didn't work
- ❌ Complex dropdown menus

#### Added Features:
✅ **Checkbox Multi-Select**
- Each layer now has a checkbox
- Select multiple layers independently of canvas selection
- "Select All" checkbox at the top
- Shows count of checked items in footer

✅ **Batch Operations Row**
- Four clean buttons for layer operations:
  - `↑ To Front` - Brings all checked shapes to the very top
  - `↑ Forward` - Moves all checked shapes up one layer
  - `↓ Backward` - Moves all checked shapes down one layer
  - `↓ To Back` - Sends all checked shapes to the very bottom
- Buttons are disabled when nothing is checked
- Hover effects for better UX

✅ **Improved Visual Design**
- Cleaner, more modern interface
- Z-index badges show current layer order
- Color-coded shape type icons
- Better visual feedback for selection states
- Simplified, professional look

**How It Works:**
1. Press `Shift+L` to open Layers Panel
2. Check one or more shapes
3. Click any batch operation button
4. All checked shapes reorder together
5. Visual feedback shows what happened

**Files Modified:** 
- `src/components/UI/LayersPanel.jsx` - Complete rewrite (489 lines)

### 3. **Redesigned Shape Toolbar** 🎨

#### Visual Improvements:
- ✨ **Gradient Backgrounds** - Beautiful gradient buttons instead of flat colors
- ✨ **Better Icons** - Replaced emojis with Unicode arrows (↶, ↷, ⇈, ⇊, ⎘)
- ✨ **Smooth Animations** - Hover effects, scale on click, subtle shadows
- ✨ **Professional Design** - Modern glassmorphic look with backdrop blur
- ✨ **Enhanced Tooltips** - Two-line tooltips showing label and shortcut

#### Button States:
- **Default:** White gradient with subtle shadow
- **Hover:** Blue gradient with larger shadow and lift effect
- **Active:** Darker blue gradient with scale animation
- **Disabled:** Gray gradient, reduced opacity, no interaction

#### New Icons:
| Old | New | Purpose |
|-----|-----|---------|
| ⬆️ | ⇈ | To Front |
| 🔼 | ⇑ | Forward |
| 🔽 | ⇓ | Backward |
| ⬇️ | ⇊ | To Back |
| - | ⎘ | Duplicate |
| ◀ | ↶ | Undo |
| ▶ | ↷ | Redo |

**Files Modified:** 
- `src/components/Canvas/ShapeToolbar.jsx` - Complete redesign (262 lines)

---

### 4. **Duplication Feature** ⎘

**Feature:** Duplicate selected shapes with full undo/redo support, exactly like copy+paste.

**How It Works:**
1. Duplicates work identically to copy+paste internally
2. Uses `CreateShapeCommand` for proper undo support
3. Batches multiple duplications into one undo operation
4. Offsets duplicated shapes by 20 pixels
5. Automatically selects the duplicated shapes
6. Each duplication is a separate command with its own ID
7. Undoing removes shapes in reverse order correctly
8. References correct Firebase documents for each shape

**Key Implementation Details:**
```javascript
const handleDuplicate = async () => {
  // Batch if multiple shapes
  const shouldBatch = shapesToDuplicate.length > 1;
  if (shouldBatch) {
    startBatch(`Duplicated ${shapesToDuplicate.length} shapes`);
  }
  
  // Create command for each shape with new ID
  for (const shape of shapesToDuplicate) {
    const newShape = {
      ...shape,
      id: `shape_${Date.now()}_${Math.random()}`, // New ID!
      x: shape.x + 20,
      y: shape.y + 20
    };
    
    const command = new CreateShapeCommand(
      CANVAS_ID, newShape, user, createShape, deleteShape
    );
    await execute(command, user);
  }
  
  // End batch to group as single undo operation
  if (shouldBatch) await endBatch();
}
```

**Why It Works Like Copy+Paste:**
- Each duplicated shape gets a unique Firebase document ID
- Commands store the correct shape ID in `CreateShapeCommand`
- Undo deletes the correct document by ID
- Batching ensures multiple duplicates = one undo operation
- Firebase transactions ensure atomicity

**Files Modified:** 
- `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.jsx` - `handleDuplicate` function (lines 1074-1135)

## Technical Implementation

### Checkbox State Management
```javascript
const [checkedIds, setCheckedIds] = useState([]);

const handleCheckboxChange = (shapeId, isChecked) => {
  if (isChecked) {
    setCheckedIds(prev => [...prev, shapeId]);
  } else {
    setCheckedIds(prev => prev.filter(id => id !== shapeId));
  }
};
```

### Batch Operations
```javascript
const handleBatchOperation = async (operation) => {
  if (checkedIds.length === 0) return;
  
  for (const id of checkedIds) {
    await operation(id); // Calls onBringToFront, etc.
  }
};
```

### Gradient Button Styles
```javascript
const getButtonStyle = () => {
  if (isDisabled) {
    return {
      background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #4b5563 0%, #374151 100%)',
      cursor: 'not-allowed',
      opacity: 0.4
    };
  }
  if (isActive) {
    return {
      background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #2563eb 0%, #1d4ed8 100%)',
      transform: 'scale(0.95)',
      boxShadow: '0 2px 8px rgba(37, 99, 235, 0.4)'
    };
  }
  if (isHovered) {
    return {
      background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #3b82f6 0%, #2563eb 100%)',
      transform: 'translateY(-1px)',
      boxShadow: '0 4px 12px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.3)'
    };
  }
  return {
    background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #ffffff 0%, #f3f4f6 100%)',
  };
};
```

## Usage Guide

### Using Checkboxes in Layers Panel
1. Press `Shift+L` to open Layers Panel
2. Check individual shapes by clicking their checkboxes
3. OR click "Select All" to check all shapes
4. Use the batch operation buttons to reorder all checked shapes
5. Footer shows: "X layers total • Y checked"

### Using the Duplicate Button
1. Select one or more shapes on the canvas
2. Click the `⎘` (Duplicate) button in the toolbar
3. Duplicates appear offset by 20 pixels
4. New shapes are automatically selected
5. Press `Cmd+Z` to undo the duplication
6. All duplicated shapes are removed in one undo operation

### Using Keyboard Shortcuts (Now Fixed!)

## Visual Comparisons

- Z-index badges
- Professional appearance
- Clear, intuitive workflow

### Toolbar - Before vs After

**Before:**
- Flat emoji buttons (⬆️🔼🔽⬇️)

## Known Behavior

### Checkbox vs Canvas Selection
The Layers Panel checkboxes are **independent** from canvas selection:
- You can check shapes without selecting them on canvas
- You can select shapes on canvas without checking them
- Both systems work together harmoniously

### Batch Operation Order
When reordering multiple checked shapes:
- They are processed in the order they appear in the list
- All shapes move together
- Z-index values are recalculated properly

### Duplicate Offset
Duplicated shapes are offset by 20 pixels diagonally:
- Prevents exact overlap
- Makes duplicates immediately visible
- Consistent with copy+paste behavior

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Drag-to-Reorder** - Drag layers to change order
2. **Group Operations** - Group multiple shapes
3. **Keyboard Shortcut for Duplicate** - Add `Cmd+D`
4. **Color-Code Layers** - Custom colors per layer
5. **Layer Thumbnails** - Small preview images
