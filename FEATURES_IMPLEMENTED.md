## 📋 Next Steps

### To Complete Layers Panel Integration:
1. Add state in `Canvas.jsx` for layers panel visibility
2. Add keyboard shortcut (suggest 'L' key to toggle)
3. Implement handlers:
   - `handleLayerRename(id, newName)` - Update shape name in Firestore
   - `handleToggleVisibility(id)` - Toggle `hidden` property
   - `handleToggleLock(id)` - Toggle `isLocked` property
4. Render `<LayersPanel />` component
5. Add toggle button in toolbar

### Future Enhancements (From Tasks):
- **Drag-to-reorder layers** (update z-index)
- **Grouping layers** (create parent-child relationships)
- **Layer thumbnails** (show preview of shape)
- **Right-click context menu** (Delete, Duplicate, Group)
- **Undo/Redo integration** (wrap all operations in commands)
- **Multi-select in layers** (Shift+click, Cmd+click)

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### Text Formatting
- Added props to Konva `<Text>` component:
  - `fontFamily`
  - `fontStyle` (normal/italic)
  - `fontWeight` (normal/bold)
  - `textDecoration` (underline)
  - `align` (left/center/right)
  - `lineHeight`
- These props are stored in Firestore and synced in real-time

### Undo/Redo
- Command Pattern allows reversible operations
- Undo stack and redo stack managed separately
- Redo stack cleared on new command execution
- Max 100 commands in history (configurable)
- Listeners notify React components of stack changes

### Layers Panel
- Shapes sorted by z-index (highest first)
- Search filter by shape name or type
- Hidden shapes have reduced opacity in list
- Locked shapes prevent interaction
- Double-click to rename (Enter to save, Esc to cancel)

## 🎨 UX Improvements

### Text Formatting Toolbar
- **Context-aware:** Only appears when text shape selected
- **Smart positioning:** Avoids screen edges
- **Immediate feedback:** Changes apply as you type
- **Visual consistency:** Matches modern design tools

### Undo/Redo
- **Toast messages:** Clear feedback on what was undone/redone
- **Standard shortcuts:** Familiar to all users
- **Non-blocking:** Errors don't break the app
- **State-aware:** Buttons/shortcuts disabled when unavailable

### Layers Panel
- **Quick search:** Find layers by name instantly
- **Visual hierarchy:** Color-coded shape types
- **Inline editing:** Double-click to rename
- **Toggle actions:** One-click to show/hide, lock/unlock
- **Clear feedback:** Selected layers highlighted

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Text Formatting
- ⚠️ Gradient fills on text shapes may conflict with font color
- ⚠️ Toolbar position may go off-screen on very zoomed canvases
- ⚠️ No undo/redo for text formatting changes yet

### Undo/Redo
- ⚠️ Commands not yet integrated with create/update/delete operations
- ⚠️ Multi-user conflicts not handled (what if User A undoes User B's action?)
- ⚠️ No persistence across page refreshes
- ⚠️ No undo for real-time drag operations (RTDB streams)

### Layers Panel
- ⚠️ Not yet integrated into Canvas.jsx
- ⚠️ No drag-to-reorder functionality
- ⚠️ Z-index not implemented (shapes don't have z-index yet)
- ⚠️ Visibility toggle not implemented in renderer
- ⚠️ Lock toggle conflicts with existing locking system

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Text Formatting:
1. `npm run dev`
2. Sign in
3. Press 'T' to create text shape
4. Click to select text shape
5. Text formatting toolbar should appear below shape
6. Change font family → Should update immediately
7. Toggle bold/italic/underline → Should update immediately
8. Change alignment → Should update immediately
9. Adjust line height slider → Should update immediately
10. Open second browser → Should see formatted text in real-time

### Test Undo/Redo:
1. Create several shapes (R, C, L, T)
2. Delete a shape (select + Delete key)
3. Press **Cmd+Z** → Should show toast "Undo: Deleted rectangle"
4. But shape won't actually come back (commands not integrated yet)
5. This demonstrates the infrastructure works, but operation integration is pending

### Test Layers Panel (After Integration):
1. Create multiple shapes
2. Press 'L' key (or click Layers button)
3. Panel should slide in from right
4. Double-click layer name → Edit and rename
5. Click eye icon → Toggle visibility
6. Click lock icon → Toggle lock
7. Search for layer name → Should filter list
8. Click layer → Should select on canvas

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness

**Current Status:** ✅ Ready for Dev/Staging

**For Production:**

1. **Integrate Layers Panel** into Canvas.jsx
2. **Add visibility toggle** to ShapeRenderer
3. **Add z-index** to shape schema
4. **Test multi-user** with layers panel

### Priority 2 (Medium Impact):
1. **Wrap operations in commands** for full undo/redo
2. **Add keyboard shortcuts** to Help Menu
3. **Persist undo stack** to localStorage
4. **Add layer thumbnails**

### Priority 3 (Nice to Have):
1. **Drag-to-reorder layers**
2. **Layer grouping**
3. **Right-click context menus**
