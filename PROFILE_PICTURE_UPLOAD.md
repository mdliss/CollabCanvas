# Profile Picture Upload Feature

## Overview
Added the ability for users to upload and change their profile pictures by clicking on their avatar in the account dropdown.

## Implementation Date
October 15, 2025

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:

#### 1. `/src/services/profilePicture.js` (103 lines)
Profile picture upload service with Firebase Storage integration:

**Functions:**
- `uploadProfilePicture(userId, file)` - Upload image to Storage and update Firestore
- `deleteProfilePicture(photoURL)` - Delete old image from Storage
- `replaceProfilePicture(userId, file, oldPhotoURL)` - Upload new + delete old in one call

**Features:**
- ✅ File validation (images only, 5MB max)
- ✅ Unique filename generation with timestamp
- ✅ Automatic Firestore profile update
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages

**Storage Path:** `/profile-pictures/{userId}/{timestamp}.{extension}`

#### 2. `/storage.rules` (21 lines)
Firebase Storage security rules:

```javascript
// Users can only upload to their own folder
allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId
             && request.resource.size < 5MB
             && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');

// Any authenticated user can read profile pictures
allow read: if request.auth != null;
```

### Modified Files:

#### 1. `/src/services/firebase.js` (Updated)
Added Firebase Storage export:
```javascript
import { getStorage } from "firebase/storage";
export const storage = getStorage(app);
```

#### 2. `/src/components/Auth/AuthBar.jsx` (Updated, 632 lines)
Enhanced account dropdown with clickable avatar:

**New State:**
- `uploadingPhoto` - Loading state during upload
- `fileInputRef` - Reference to hidden file input

**New Functions:**
- `handlePhotoUpload(event)` - Handle file selection and upload
- `triggerPhotoUpload()` - Open file picker

**UI Changes:**
- Avatar wrapped in clickable button
- Hover effect: dark overlay + "Change" text

## How It Works

### Upload Flow:
```
1. User clicks avatar in account dropdown
   ↓
2. File picker opens
   ↓
3. User selects image
   ↓
4. Validate file type and size
   ↓
5. Show "Uploading..." on avatar
   ↓
6. Upload to Firebase Storage
   ↓
7. Get download URL
   ↓
8. Update Firestore profile with new photoURL
   ↓
9. Delete old profile picture (if exists)
   ↓
10. UI updates automatically
```

### Security:
- Storage rules enforce:
  - Users can only upload to their own folder
  - Images only (validated by MIME type)
  - 5MB max file size
  - Any authenticated user can read profile pictures

---

## Setup Required (ONE-TIME)

### ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Enable Firebase Storage**

Firebase Storage must be initialized in the Firebase Console before this feature will work.

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/collabcanvas-99a09/storage
2. Click **"Get Started"**
3. Choose **"Start in production mode"** (we have custom rules)
4. Select your location (e.g., `us-central1`)
5. Click **"Done"**

### Deploy Storage Rules
After enabling Storage in console, deploy the rules:
```bash
cd /Users/max/CollabCanvas
firebase deploy --only storage
```

Expected output:
```
✔  Deploy complete!
✔  storage: released rules storage.rules
```

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites:
1. Enable Firebase Storage in console (see above)
2. Deploy storage rules
3. Dev server running at http://localhost:5178/

### Test Steps:

#### 1. **Upload New Profile Picture**
- [ ] Sign in with email/password (no existing photo)
- [ ] Open account dropdown (click your avatar at top)
- [ ] Hover over avatar → sees dark overlay + "Change" text
- [ ] Click avatar → file picker opens
- [ ] Select an image (e.g., a .jpg photo)
- [ ] Avatar shows "Uploading..." briefly
- [ ] Avatar updates with new image immediately
- [ ] Close dropdown and reopen → new image persists

#### 2. **Replace Existing Picture**
- [ ] Already have a profile picture
- [ ] Open account dropdown
- [ ] Click avatar and select a different image
- [ ] New image uploads and displays
- [ ] Old image deleted from Storage (check Firebase Console)

#### 3. **Validation - File Too Large**
- [ ] Try uploading a 6MB+ image
- [ ] Expected: Error alert "Image must be less than 5MB"
- [ ] Avatar not updated

#### 4. **Validation - Wrong File Type**
- [ ] Try uploading a .pdf or .txt file
- [ ] Expected: Error alert "File must be an image"
- [ ] Avatar not updated

#### 5. **Google OAuth User**
- [ ] Sign in with Google (already has photoURL)
- [ ] Upload new image
- [ ] Expected: Google photo replaced with uploaded image
- [ ] Old Google photo URL not deleted (external URL)

#### 6. **Avatar Updates Everywhere**
- [ ] Upload new profile picture
- [ ] Check cursor labels (move mouse on canvas)
- [ ] Check presence list (upper-right corner)
- [ ] Check other user's view (profile popup in presence list)
- [ ] Expected: New avatar shows in all locations

## Technical Details

### Firebase Storage Structure:
```
storage/
└── profile-pictures/
    ├── {userId1}/
    │   ├── 1729012345678.jpg
    │   └── 1729023456789.png
    └── {userId2}/
        └── 1729034567890.jpg
```

### Firestore Profile Update:
```javascript
// Before upload
{
  uid: "abc123",
  displayName: "Max Liss",
  photoURL: null,  // or Google OAuth URL
  bio: "Designer",
  // ...
}

// After upload
{
  uid: "abc123",
  displayName: "Max Liss",
  photoURL: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/.../profile-pictures/abc123/1729012345678.jpg",
  bio: "Designer",
  // ...
}
```

### Performance:
- **Upload time:** ~1-3 seconds for typical profile picture (500KB-2MB)
- **Storage cost:** $0.026/GB/month (negligible for profile pictures)
- **Network cost:** $0.12/GB egress (when images are viewed)
- **Typical profile picture:** 100-500KB (after user resizes)

### Security:
- **Client-side validation:** File type and size checked before upload
- **Server-side validation:** Storage rules enforce MIME type and size limits
- **Access control:** Users can only upload to their own folder
- **Read permissions:** Any authenticated user can view profile pictures

## Known Limitations

1. **No Image Cropping/Resizing**
   - Users must crop/resize images before uploading
   - Future enhancement: Add client-side image cropping tool

2. **No Preview Before Upload**
   - Image uploads immediately after selection
   - Future enhancement: Show preview with confirm/cancel buttons

3. **Storage Must Be Enabled First**
   - Firebase Storage must be initialized in console
   - Cannot be done programmatically
   - One-time setup required

4. **Hover Effect on Nested Elements**
   - Hover overlay uses inline styles (not ideal for complex interactions)
   - Future enhancement: Convert to CSS classes

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Image Cropping**
   - Add client-side image cropper (e.g., react-image-crop)
   - Allow users to crop to square aspect ratio
   - Resize to optimal dimensions (256x256px)

2. **Drag & Drop Upload**
   - Allow dragging images directly onto avatar
   - Show drop zone indicator

3. **Upload Progress Bar**
   - Show percentage during upload (0-100%)
   - Better visual feedback for large files

4. **Image Compression**
   - Automatically compress images before upload
   - Reduce storage costs and load times
   - Use browser-image-compression library

5. **Remove Photo Option**
   - "Remove photo" button to delete profile picture
   - Revert to initials avatar

6. **Upload History**
   - Show previous profile pictures
   - Allow reverting to old photo

7. **Avatar Gallery**
   - Provide default avatar options
   - Let users choose from preset images

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Firebase Storage has not been set up"
**Solution:** Enable Storage in Firebase Console:
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/collabcanvas-99a09/storage
2. Click "Get Started"
3. Choose production mode
4. Deploy storage rules: `firebase deploy --only storage`

### Problem: Upload fails with CORS error
**Solution:** CORS is automatically configured for Firebase Storage. If issues persist:
1. Check Storage rules are deployed
2. Verify user is authenticated
3. Check browser console for detailed error

### Problem: "Image must be less than 5MB" but file is smaller
**Solution:** File size is in bytes, not megabytes. Check actual file size:
```javascript
console.log('File size:', file.size, 'bytes');
console.log('File size:', (file.size / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(2), 'MB');
```

### Problem: Old photos not being deleted
**Solution:** 
- Only Firebase Storage URLs are deleted (not Google OAuth URLs)
- Check console logs for deletion errors
- Deletion is best-effort (won't fail upload if deletion fails)

### Problem: Avatar not updating after upload
**Solution:**
- Check if photoURL updated in Firestore
- Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check if user.photoURL reflects new URL

## Code Examples

### Using the Service Directly
```javascript
import { uploadProfilePicture, deleteProfilePicture } from './services/profilePicture';

// Upload new profile picture
const newPhotoURL = await uploadProfilePicture(userId, imageFile);

// Delete old profile picture
await deleteProfilePicture(oldPhotoURL);

// Replace (upload new + delete old)
import { replaceProfilePicture } from './services/profilePicture';
const newPhotoURL = await replaceProfilePicture(userId, imageFile, oldPhotoURL);
```

### File Validation Example
```javascript
const validateImage = (file) => {
  // Check type
  if (!file.type.startsWith('image/')) {
    throw new Error('File must be an image');
  }
  
  // Check size (5MB = 5 * 1024 * 1024 bytes)
  if (file.size > 5 * 1024 * 1024) {
    throw new Error('Image must be less than 5MB');
  }
  
  return true;
};
```

---

## Storage Costs Estimate

Assuming 100 active users with profile pictures:
- **Storage:** 100 users × 500KB average = 50MB = $0.001/month
- **Downloads:** 100 users × 10 views/day × 30 days × 500KB = 15GB = $1.80/month
- **Uploads:** Negligible cost

**Total estimated cost: ~$2/month for 100 active users**

## Security Considerations

### Storage Rules Enforce:
- ✅ Users can only upload to their own folder
- ✅ Images only (MIME type validation)
- ✅ 5MB max file size
- ✅ Authenticated users required
- ✅ Anyone authenticated can read (necessary for collaboration)

### Privacy:
- Profile pictures are public to all authenticated users
- Cannot make profile pictures private (needed for avatars)
- Users should be informed photos are visible to other users

### Abuse Prevention:
- File size limit prevents storage abuse
- Per-user folder prevents users from uploading to others' folders
- MIME type validation prevents non-image uploads
