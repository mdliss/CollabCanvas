## 🚀 This Session's Accomplishments

### Completed PR #5: Object Locking

**Problem:** Lock functions existed but weren't connected to UI  
**Solution:** Full wiring + automatic cleanup + visual feedback

#### Changes Made:
1. **Added `staleLockSweeper` function** (`canvas.js`)
   - Runs every 2 seconds
   - Clears locks older than 5s
   - Logs cleanup count

2. **Wired lock handlers** (`Canvas.jsx`)
   - `handleRequestLock` calls `tryLockShape`
   - `handleShapeDragEnd` calls `unlockShape`
   - Passed `currentUserId` and `onRequestLock` to Shape

3. **Added automatic cleanup timer** (`Canvas.jsx`)
   - `setInterval(staleLockSweeper, 2000)`
   - Triggers on `visibilitychange` event
   - Cleans up on unmount

4. **Enhanced selection badges** (`Canvas.jsx`)
   - Show "🔒 {name}" for locked shapes
   - Uses lock owner's color
   - Looks up display name from `onlineUsers`

#### Files Modified:
```
src/services/canvas.js           +43 lines  (staleLockSweeper)
src/components/Canvas/Canvas.jsx +60 lines  (lock wiring + badges)
tasks.md                         +491 lines (evidence + status)
PR5_LOCKING_COMPLETE.md          NEW        (documentation)
```

#### Build Status:
```bash
✅ npm run lint   # Exit 0
✅ npm run build  # Exit 0, 1.2MB bundle
```

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Firestore (Persistent State)
```
Collection: canvas
Document: global-canvas-v1
  └─ shapes: [
       {
         id, type, x, y, width, height, fill,
         createdBy, createdAt, lastModifiedBy, lastModifiedAt,
         isLocked, lockedBy, lockedAt
       }
     ]
```

### RTDB (Ephemeral State)
```
/sessions/global-canvas-v1/{uid}
  ├─ displayName: string
  ├─ cursorColor: string
  ├─ cursorX: number
  ├─ cursorY: number
  ├─ online: boolean
  └─ lastSeen: timestamp

/selections/global-canvas-v1/{shapeId}
  ├─ uid: string
  ├─ name: string
  ├─ color: string
  └─ ts: timestamp
```

### Data Flow
```
User Action → Hook → Service → Firebase → onSnapshot/onValue → State → UI
     ↓            ↓        ↓         ↓            ↓              ↓      ↓
  onClick   useCursors  cursors.js  RTDB    watchCursors()   cursors  <Cursor>
```

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Manual Acceptance Tests (PR #8)

#### Test 1: Two-Window Lock Flow
```
Window A (User A):
1. Login as user1@test.com
2. Create rectangle
3. Start dragging → Lock acquired
4. Release drag → Lock released

Window B (User B):
1. Login as user2@test.com
2. See rectangle appear
3. When A drags → See red border + "🔒 User A" badge
4. Try to drag → Blocked (draggable=false)
5. When A releases → Badge disappears
6. Drag now works
```

#### Test 2: Stale Lock Cleanup
```
Window A:
1. Start dragging rectangle
2. Close browser immediately (no cleanup)

Window B:
1. See lock badge appear
2. Wait 5+ seconds
3. Lock should auto-clear via staleLockSweeper
4. Badge disappears
5. Shape becomes draggable
```

#### Test 3: Cursor Sync
```
Windows A & B side-by-side:
1. Move mouse in A
2. See labeled cursor in B within 50ms
3. Cursor position matches exactly
4. Name and color consistent
```

#### Test 4: Presence Tracking
```
Start: Window A shows "Presence: 1"
1. Open Window B (different user)
2. A shows "Presence: 2"
3. Close B
4. A shows "Presence: 1" within 3 seconds
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues
1. **Delete Key:** Doesn't check locks yet (Shape.jsx checks, Canvas.jsx doesn't)
2. **Lock Owner Left:** Badge shows "🔒 Locked" instead of name
3. **Selection Priority:** Lock badge overrides selection badge

### Out of Scope (Post-MVP)
- Undo/redo
- Multiple shape types (circles, text)
- Shape resizing/rotation
- Multi-select
- Custom colors

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Worked Well
1. **Flat RTDB structure** — Single node per user = simpler queries
2. **Stage event listeners** — Direct Konva events bypass React re-renders
3. **Transaction-based locking** — Prevents race conditions
4. **Evidence-based checklist** — tasks.md with inline proof

### What Was Fixed
1. **RTDB URL validation** — Updated regex for firebasedatabase.com
2. **Lock wiring gap** — Shape handlers existed but weren't called
3. **Stale lock problem** — No cleanup meant locks lasted forever
4. **Badge missing** — Selection badges didn't show lock owners
