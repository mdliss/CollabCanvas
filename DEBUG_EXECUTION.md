# 🔍 DEBUGGING AI EXECUTION - COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE

## PURPOSE

This guide helps you diagnose why AI operations might not be executing. With the aggressive logging now added, you can trace exactly where execution stops.

---

## 🚀 BEFORE TESTING - DEPLOY FIRST!

**CRITICAL**: You MUST deploy the backend before testing!

```bash
# 1. Rebuild backend with all fixes
cd functions
npm run build

# 2. Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy --only functions:aiCanvasAgent

# 3. Restart frontend
cd ..
npm run dev
```

**If you skip deployment**, the old backend code will run and operations won't work!

---

## 🧪 DIAGNOSTIC TEST

### Step 1: Open Browser Console

1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Clear console (click 🚫 icon)

### Step 2: Test Simple Operation

1. Sign in to the app
2. Click purple AI button (bottom-right)
3. Type: **"Create a red circle at 15000, 15000"**
4. Press Enter
5. **WATCH THE CONSOLE CAREFULLY**

---

## 📊 WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN CONSOLE

### Scenario A: Backend Not Deployed

**Console Shows**:
```
[AI] Received response from backend: {
  hasOperations: false,
  operationsCount: 0,
  ...
}
[AI] No operations to execute (query-only or conversational response)
```

**Diagnosis**: Backend is running OLD code that doesn't return operations  
**Fix**: Deploy backend with `firebase deploy --only functions:aiCanvasAgent`

---

### Scenario B: Operations Array Empty

**Console Shows**:
```
[AI] Received response from backend: {
  hasOperations: true,
  operationsCount: 0,  ← ZERO!
  operations: []  ← EMPTY!
}
[AI executeOperations] ⚠️ No operations to execute - array is empty
```

**Diagnosis**: AI didn't call any tools, just returned conversational response  
**Fix**: This is normal for conversational queries like "hello". Try a creation command.

---

### Scenario C: Execution Starts But Fails

**Console Shows**:
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[AI executeOperations] ⚡ STARTING EXECUTION
[AI executeOperations] Operations received: [...]
[AI executeOperations] Is array? true
[AI executeOperations] Length: 1

[AI executeOperations] Shape data prepared: {...}
[AI executeOperations] Creating CreateShapeCommand...
[AI executeOperations] Calling execute() through undo system...
❌ [AI executeOperations] execute() failed: [ERROR MESSAGE]
```

**Diagnosis**: Execution started but failed at specific step  
**Fix**: Read the error message, fix the specific issue

---

### Scenario D: Execution Completes Successfully

**Console Shows**:
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[AI executeOperations] ⚡ STARTING EXECUTION
[AI executeOperations] Operations received: [...]
[AI executeOperations] Is array? true
[AI executeOperations] Length: 1
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[RTDB createShape] Creating shape with ID: shape_abc123  ← From canvasRTDB.js
[RTDB createShape] Shape created successfully: shape_abc123 ← From canvasRTDB.js
[AI executeOperations] ✅ execute() completed successfully
[AI executeOperations] ✅ Successfully created circle with ID: shape_abc123
[AI] ✅ Successfully executed 1 operations. Created shape IDs: shape_abc123
```

**Diagnosis**: Everything working perfectly!  
**Result**: Shape should appear on canvas ✅

## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue #1: "execute is not a function"

**Console**:
```
[AI executeOperations] Checking required functions:
  - execute: undefined  ← PROBLEM!
```

**Cause**: useUndo() hook not providing execute function  
**Fix**: Verify imports, check UndoContext is wrapping App component

---

### Issue #2: "user is not authenticated"

**Console**:
```
[AI executeOperations] Checking required functions:
  - user: NOT AUTHENTICATED!
```

**Cause**: User not signed in or useAuth() hook failing  
**Fix**: Sign in to the app before using AI

---

### Issue #3: Backend returns empty operations

**Console**:
```
[AI] Received response from backend: {
  hasOperations: true,
  operationsCount: 0,
  operations: []
}
```

**Cause**: AI didn't call any tools, or tools returned only queries  
**Fix**: Check backend logs for tool calls:
```bash
firebase functions:log --only aiCanvasAgent --limit 20
```

Look for:
```
[AI Agent] Planning tool: create_shape {...}
```

If you see this, tools ARE being called. If not, AI isn't using tools.

---

### Issue #4: Command creation fails

**Console**:
```
[AI executeOperations] Creating CreateShapeCommand...
❌ Error: CreateShapeCommand is not a constructor
```

**Cause**: Import issue with Command classes  
**Fix**: Verify import statement:
```javascript
import { CreateShapeCommand, ... } from '../../utils/commands';
```

---

### Issue #5: RTDB write fails

**Console**:
```
[AI executeOperations] Calling execute()...
[UndoManager] Command executed...
❌ [RTDB createShape] Validation error: ...
```

**Cause**: Shape data validation failing  
**Fix**: Check shape data format, ensure all required fields present

---

## 📝 DETAILED LOGGING GUIDE

With the new aggressive logging, here's what each log means:

### Execution Start
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[AI executeOperations] ⚡ STARTING EXECUTION
```
**Meaning**: executeOperations() function was called  
**If you DON'T see this**: operations array was empty or undefined

### Operations Received
```
[AI executeOperations] Operations received: [{ ... }]
```
**Meaning**: Backend sent this operations array  
**If array is []**: No operations to execute (normal for queries)  
**If array has items**: Should proceed to execution

### Function Availability Check
```
[AI executeOperations] Checking required functions:
  - execute: function
  - createShape: function
```
**Meaning**: All required functions are available  
**If any show "undefined"**: Import or context issue

### Operation Processing
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[AI executeOperations] 🔄 Processing operation 1/3
```
**Meaning**: Starting to process this specific operation  
**If you don't see this**: Loop isn't running (array issue)

### Case Execution
```
[AI executeOperations] create_shape case START
```
**Meaning**: Entered the create_shape case in switch statement  
**If you don't see this**: Operation type not matching any case

### Shape Data Prepared
```
[AI executeOperations] Shape data prepared: {...}
```
**Meaning**: Shape data object created successfully  
**If you don't see this**: Error before this step

### Command Creation
```
[AI executeOperations] Creating CreateShapeCommand...
```
**Meaning**: About to create Command object  
**If error after this**: Command constructor issue

### Execute Call
```
[AI executeOperations] Calling execute() through undo system...
```
**Meaning**: About to call execute(command, user)  
**If error after this**: execute() function issue

### RTDB Write
```
[RTDB createShape] Creating shape with ID: shape_abc123
[RTDB createShape] Shape created successfully
```
**Meaning**: Shape written to database  
**If you see this but no shape appears**: Real-time sync issue (unlikely)

### Success
```
[AI executeOperations] ✅ Successfully created circle with ID: shape_abc123
```
**Meaning**: Operation completed fully  
**Should see shape on canvas**

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING WORKFLOW

### If Operations Don't Execute:

1. **Check Console for Logs**
   - Do you see "STARTING EXECUTION"?
   - Is operations array empty?
   - Are required functions available?

2. **Check Backend Deployment**
   - Run: `firebase functions:list | grep aiCanvasAgent`
   - Should show: `✔ aiCanvasAgent(us-central1)`
   - Check last deploy time is recent

3. **Check Backend Logs**
   ```bash
   firebase functions:log --only aiCanvasAgent --limit 50
   ```
   - Look for: `[AI Agent] Planning tool: create_shape`
   - If missing: Tools aren't being called

4. **Verify Response Structure**
   - Check console log: `[AI] Received response from backend:`
   - Should have `hasOperations: true`
   - Should have `operationsCount > 0`
   - Should have `operations: [...]` with array

5. **Test Manual Operations**
   - Click "R" key to create rectangle manually
   - Does it work?
   - If YES: RTDB is fine, issue is AI execution
   - If NO: RTDB or canvas is broken (bigger problem)

## 🚨 ERROR SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: "Operations received: []"

**Log**:
```
[AI executeOperations] Operations received: []
[AI executeOperations] Length: 0
[AI executeOperations] ⚠️ No operations to execute - array is empty
```

**Problem**: Backend didn't return any operations  
**Possible Causes**:
1. Backend not deployed (old code running)
2. AI didn't call any tools
3. All tools were queries (not operations)

**Solution**:
1. Redeploy backend: `firebase deploy --only functions:aiCanvasAgent`
2. Check backend logs: `firebase functions:log --only aiCanvasAgent`
3. Try a clear creation command: "Create a red circle at 15000, 15000"

---

### Scenario 2: "execute: undefined"

**Log**:
```
[AI executeOperations] Checking required functions:
  - execute: undefined  ← PROBLEM!
```

**Problem**: useUndo() hook not providing execute function  
**Possible Causes**:
1. UndoContext not wrapping component
2. Import issue
3. Context provider missing

**Solution**:
Check `src/App.jsx` has:
```javascript
<UndoProvider>
  <AppContent />
</UndoProvider>
```

---

### Scenario 3: "user: NOT AUTHENTICATED!"

**Log**:
```
[AI executeOperations] Checking required functions:
  - user: NOT AUTHENTICATED!
```

**Problem**: No user object available  
**Solution**: Sign in to the app before using AI

---

### Scenario 4: Command Execution Fails

**Log**:
```
[AI executeOperations] Calling execute() through undo system...
[AI executeOperations] ❌ execute() failed: [ERROR]
```

**Problem**: Command execution threw error  
**Solution**: Read the error message, fix the specific issue

Common errors:
- "Shape must have type and id" → shapeData missing required fields
- "Invalid coordinates" → coordinates outside bounds
- "Invalid color format" → color not valid hex

## 💡 ADVANCED DEBUGGING

### Enable Firebase Emulator Logging

```bash
# In functions/src/index.ts, add at top of aiCanvasAgent:
console.log('[Backend] Request received:', req.body);

# Before returning response:
console.log('[Backend] Sending response:', {
  messageLength: finalResponse?.length,
  operationsCount: operations.length,
  operations: operations
});
```

### Test Backend Directly with curl

```bash
# Get your auth token first (from browser console):
# user.getIdToken().then(t => console.log(t))

curl -X POST https://us-central1-collabcanvas-99a09.cloudfunctions.net/aiCanvasAgent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Create a red circle at 15000, 15000"}
    ]
  }' | jq
```

**Check response**:
- Should have `operations` array
- Should have operation objects with `type`, `operation`, `params`
